ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Jessica L. Roll√©n,5,"The food was good and the staff was superb. The dining room is also beautiful. We went for a weekday lunch and it was very much a business crowd. The vibe is borderline stuffy, but the staff was so kind that their warmth offset that.",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Dae M,5,Michael's is the perfect fine dining experience. I came here for my mother's 40th birthday and I really want to thank the staff for making it memorable. A complimentary birthday cake was given to us and the staff sang her happy birthday. The setting is luxurious and the wait staff have everything down to absolute perfection. The margarita pie was warm and cheesy and the fish was well seasoned and presented. I want to thank the manager Basdeo for making our night so special.,New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Sree Sreenivasan,5,"Classic NY power breakfast! Went on Juneteenth holiday, so it was easy to get into and to enjoy. First class food and service at business class prices.",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Rainer,2,"No. For the true New Yorkers, this place is a No. From the sidewalk the space looks nice but as soon as you get seated and settle in you realize it's very stale. If you sit along the east wall you will easily notice the dirty air vents close to the top of the ceiling followed by a not so pretty ceiling. The room is dated, the Christmas garland along the ceiling looked sad, like it's been the same weak rope garland used since 2008 or something. Everyone wrote the service is amazing but I didn't get that at all. It was just myself and my wife. After they took our order, for a good 7 or so minutes we just sat there with water and finally noticed others had bread. We had been sitting for a while with just drinks and no one offered us bread. We had to ask for bread from another waiter and it still took a few long minutes to finally get bread. The crab cake was the size of a small burger patty and the pomegranate salad had huge leaves that were awkward to cut and eat. The raviolis were weak and not creamy, more oily. The bowl for the brussel sprouts was too small for the foods and wasn't the easiest to eat out of bc we didn't want to tip it over. I don't understand all the positive reviews on the food and service. The service seemed less engaged and mostly robotic. The food seemed  basic compared to the prices. They'd forget to bring back another drink so my wife was stuck with water for most of the meal until we reminded them. We vibe was just off. Honestly it mostly tourists around the room. We didn't need to try the dessert. This was a miss for us. Again the room is just stale. Not cute, not styled, no one cares enough type of feeling. I don't write reviews but this one just had to be done",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Pd,5,"I had the perfect dinner here for Valentine‚Äôs Day! Great food, atmosphere and staff all around. Appetizers to dessert was all delicious. I am not even a fan of Kale but even their Kale Caesar Salad was so tasty; I finished it.
I definitely recommend this place.",New York
ChIJvx7i_BlawokRidb5WfdvqRM,Sarah P,5,"This review is for La Pizza e La Pasta restaurant located in Eataly. All the food was amazing especially the meat and cheese board - it really exceeded our expectations. The pizza was excellent too. The only complaint was that they brought out entrees before we were finished with the appetizers, so it was hard to fully enjoy that while trying to avoid eating other food cold. I would empathize to the waiter that you want to finish your appetizers first (which should be common sense anyway) before moving on to the entrees. So other than having to eat the pizza semi-cold, it was a great experience. Gorgeous views.",New York
ChIJvx7i_BlawokRidb5WfdvqRM,Marisol Anzueta,5,From the moment we stepped into this restaurant our expectations were highly met. Patricia was so friendly and delivered exceptional service skill's.The food was scrumptious. keep up the good work. First time visiting and definitely will be back.,New York
ChIJvx7i_BlawokRidb5WfdvqRM,Amber Penders,5,"Really amazing service, food was very fresh. Wait staff were really helpful and very attentive. We had a  simple mix up with our order and they were so apologetic that it didn't annoy us as they fully made up for it, it was a very simple mistake and they made such a special experience for us to make up for it.",New York
ChIJvx7i_BlawokRidb5WfdvqRM,Hannah W,3,"Whether or not you eat here, Eataly is definitely worth a visit. I stop by every time I PATH through, to get groceries and treat myself to their exquisite yet expensive gelato. This time was for a reunion - the other participants chose La Pizza & La Pasta for our occasion. Service was the most impressive feature. Food was OK - a bit too salty for my personal preference. The panzanella salad was quite disappointing (I make a better one at home). For what they charge, the portion is certainly on the small side. We had a window table overlooking the 9/11 memorial park, on a fine day after NYC was flooded by torrential downpour - the view was quite stunning ... maybe we were also paying for that lol! All in all a nice experience for the reunion but the food has far more room for improvement. NYC is a famous hub for superb Italian food, for an establishment of Eataly's caliber, there is no excuse for mediocrity.",New York
ChIJvx7i_BlawokRidb5WfdvqRM,Jason Tai,5,"Eataly NYC Downtown truly offers a standout experience for food lovers and casual shoppers alike. This location shines in its cleanliness, beauty, and spaciousness ‚Äì a comfortable ambiance that welcomes you as you embark on your culinary journey.

Their vast collection of fine foods is impressive and well-curated, offering a diverse selection that caters to every palate. It is apparent that a lot of thought goes into each product displayed, making for a top-tier shopping and dining experience.

The venue's architectural design is truly mesmerizing, with beautiful top-to-floor windows that flood the space with natural light. This creates an inviting and uplifting atmosphere that greatly enhances your experience.

One of the best parts? It's not as crowded as the Flatiron location. This gives you the freedom to browse and enjoy at your own pace, without the typical hustle and bustle.

Eataly NYC Downtown has undeniably raised the bar for food marketplaces in the city. A visit to this gastronomic paradise is a must for any food enthusiast. Hats off to the team for creating such an outstanding destination!",New York
ChIJh-oPySxZwokRBTfrxwTdRo4,He Wi,5,"We had brunch on a Saturday and we chose to sit outside because the weather was so nice. The service was so good. Our waitress was so friendly and patient (we were with a small child and asked for an umbrella to cover us from the sun). We ordered a few things: salad, pasta, pizza, toast, and a√ßai bowl. All of them were so fresh and delicious. Somehow they just knew how to make good meal with a perfect balance of taste, texture, and temperature. All meals were worth the price. Seemed a bit high at first, but they were just so good. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!",New York
ChIJh-oPySxZwokRBTfrxwTdRo4,Herodiane Legerme,5,"FIVE STARS!! From the moment I walked in I was warmly greeted by Levi & Andres, I was given an awesome drink suggestion which was the *Bell pepper Sour* 10/10 beautifully crafted. On to my app I had the artichoke/zucchini tempura which was delightful. My Entree was the Sea Bass OMG it was exquisite!! Chefs Kiss üëåüèæ. The Menu is Pricey but worth it! I cannot wait to dine in again, customer service was top tier!",New York
ChIJh-oPySxZwokRBTfrxwTdRo4,Denby Liu,3,"We went to Lindens for a brunch as it was close to where we taking a stroll, the reviews were pretty good and I like to try out new places. Hadn't realised that it was actually part of the Arlo hotel though.

Unfortunately, food wise, we were disappointed. The main problem was that the spicy meat pizza was a lot spicier than we expected. We're not great with super spicy food so we should have checked on the spice level beforehand and I'd say this was a medium high spice level, which was bordering on the inedible for us. Though we did finish it with copious amounts of liquid to cool things down. This is probably a non-issue for other people who can tolerate spice, so for you spice lovers you may like it, but for me I just lost all sense of taste!

The burger was okay, but what annoyed me was that they wanted $12 extra for some fries, on top of the $19 for the burger. That just screamed price gouging to me and refused to pay the extra for fries on principal. If I'm going to have a burger and fries for $31 it better be a REALLY good burger to justify that cost and in no way was it that good. I agree with other food critics, I expect fries or a salad to be included with a burger and if you insist on separating it out as an extra then it should be a reasonable price, which this was not. Yes, this is a pet peeve of mine.

The service was pleasant but a little slow, so don't expect to be in a rush to get your meal over with.

We ate in the outdoor courtyard and I did like how they had decorated it. Do note there's a very big/loud AC unit from the hotel venting into the courtyard even though we were almost at the opposite end of the courtyard to it, which killed the ambiance somewhat. Having said that, if it was full up I suspect the voices of diners might drown it out a little, whereas there were only half a dozen tables occupied at the time we had the meal so it sounded loud.",New York
ChIJh-oPySxZwokRBTfrxwTdRo4,ReedH,5,"Great food at this Tribeca spot. It does have a bit of a hotel restaurant vibe, which it is, but if you can get past that, the food is really good. I‚Äôd booked for indoors but upon arriving and seeing that outdoors was in a lovely internal courtyard, as opposed to shed, I switched. They have a few interesting cocktails - I started with a tomatillo spritz which was nice and refreshing. For food, I started with the the artichoke and zucchini tempura - nice portion size with great crispiness and nice flavors. And then had their signature cheeseburger which was a nicely done smash patty burger. I‚Äôm generally not one for hotel restaurants but have to hand it to the chefs on this one.",New York
ChIJh-oPySxZwokRBTfrxwTdRo4,Amanda Burgmeier,5,We had a wonderful dinning experience in Lindens during our stay in Arlo Soho. The manager Terrell and customer service Santiago and Kelly were so friendly and kind to us. They always gave us beautiful smiles and do everything they can to make our dining experience unforgettable. Their foods were very tasty and healthy. We highly recommended this restaurant to others! We will always to choose to dine here for breakfast in the future!,New York
ChIJtb0E3RdawokRqLP-FNIxvf8,Kaitlyn McCoy,5,"Husband and I shared two pasta plates‚Äî both within the $20-30 range. The pasta was fresh, the sauce was so flavorful. The portions were decent sized and sharing ended up perfect for us. Our waiter was so, so nice and helpful! It‚Äôs a dark-ambiance kind of place! Feels fancy for very good prices. They have outdoor seating as well. Would recommend a reservation, we lucked up but we also ate there on a Tuesday evening.",New York
ChIJtb0E3RdawokRqLP-FNIxvf8,Mandy Kuo,5,Lovely restaurant. The vegetable bean soup was warming and yummy. The salmon pasta was perfectly al dente. The branzino was also pretty good. They put bacon in the brussel sprouts which caught us by surprise. Great service.,New York
ChIJtb0E3RdawokRqLP-FNIxvf8,Jason Tai,2,"I recently dined at Felice 15 Gold and unfortunately, I must say that my experience left much to be desired. While the interior of the restaurant is undeniably cozy and beautiful, I found several aspects of my visit to be rather disappointing. Therefore, I am giving this restaurant a two-star rating.

ü™ëFirst and foremost, the seating arrangements were quite uncomfortable. The tables and chairs were small, and to make matters worse, they were placed very close together. This lack of space made it difficult to fully enjoy my meal and have private conversations without feeling cramped.

‚è∞Additionally, I was disappointed with the service at Felice 15 Gold. Despite there being only two other occupied tables in the restaurant during my visit on a Sunday afternoon, it took an excessively long time for our food to be prepared and brought to the table. This prolonged wait was frustrating, especially considering the limited number of patrons.

üçùAs for the food itself, it was a mixed bag. While the main pasta dish we ordered was decent, I couldn't overlook the disappointing starter, the Tuna tartare. ü§¢The tuna had a strong, unpleasant fishy taste and did not seem fresh at all. In fact, after just one bite, my dining companions and I decided to discard the dish and cancel it. It was an unfortunate and off-putting start to the meal.

üìùOn a positive note, I must commend the waitress for her pleasant demeanor and helpfulness throughout our meal. She was attentive and accommodating, which somewhat alleviated the overall dissatisfaction caused by other aspects of our dining experience.

üòîIn conclusion, my visit to Felice 15 Gold was far from enjoyable. Uncomfortable seating, excessively long waiting times, and a subpar starter tainted the experience. Although the main pasta dish was satisfactory, it was overshadowed by the disappointments. Furthermore, the prices seemed somewhat inflated considering the overall quality. I cannot recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",New York
ChIJtb0E3RdawokRqLP-FNIxvf8,Steven Broad,3,"This is the restaurant at the Gild Hall hotel. We had breakfast here because it came with our booking (not generally the case I think). Perhaps dinner is nicer. The restaurant itself is a bit more cramped than I would prefer and the breakfast options were... Memorably disappointing. The bar/happy hour is much better. I wish I could give two completely different star ratings. But I don't think I would plan to visit for dinner based on the experience of breakfast. Perhaps that isn't fair exactly, but there are many options.",New York
ChIJtb0E3RdawokRqLP-FNIxvf8,YUE WANG,5,"Nice people, good service, nice environment and the BEST FRENCH TOAST. Recommend the wine from Italian. Summer is good for dining outside. However , I prefer the inside better since there‚Äôs a large trash spot right across the street.",New York
ChIJDVWAj4lZwokRiQQKeBiTHcI,Nitzan A,4,"The food, the location, the vibe of this place is so good! The service could use an improvement though. I had breakfast here on a weekday morning when it was very slow, and the waiters weren‚Äôt checking in on their tables, I waited a while for them to look over to ask for things, and I saw another lady in the next table trying to get their attention for so long she ended up getting up the the bar area to ask for some salt and pepper. Then they took forever to bring it over. They were nice but I feel like they could improve their service.",New York
ChIJDVWAj4lZwokRiQQKeBiTHcI,Krista M,4,"My favorite thing about NOMO Kitchen was the atmosphere and music. We went there for brunch on a Sunday at 1pm but we had no reservation. Luckily, we were able to get a table though it wasn‚Äôt on the actual floor with all the greenery. But regardless, we enjoyed the music, and the food wasn‚Äôt bad either. I had a taste of their French toast and I think I‚Äôll get that next time I go there. But overall, it‚Äôs a fun atmosphere for brunch and the prices are reasonable.",New York
ChIJDVWAj4lZwokRiQQKeBiTHcI,Yo Yo,4,I always enjoy going here. On this particular night the hostess was ever so pleasant and friendly. The waiter we had I don‚Äôt recall him introducing himself to us and just jumped right into asking what are we ordering. Anyway the food was good as always light and fresh. The skirt steak was a tad bit salty but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The drinks were ok my least favorite part about my night. The best part though was having that chocolate mousse cake.,New York
ChIJDVWAj4lZwokRiQQKeBiTHcI,Drisana,2,"the vibes were definitely there but not so much the experience with my waiter specifically. i feel like everyone else was nice and attentive, except for our waiter. he very much had a ‚Äúget them out quick, what else do you need‚Äù attitude if that makes sense. music was good, the location is dope, food is ok.",New York
ChIJDVWAj4lZwokRiQQKeBiTHcI,Deborah Alves,5,"I had mother's day dinner here it was wonderful. I loved the food. Our server was fantastic with a great personality and the atmosphere was great. I truly enjoyed myself. Each mother present was given a red rose, a beautiful gesture.  I loved it.",New York
ChIJlUTKy1VYwokREq7LLltPsGU,Eric Walters,4,"I ordered the chicken fajitas that were very good but a little skimpy on the rice, beans and tortillas for a $30 meal. Very loud at peak hours but a cool vibe.  Server kept us waiting and we had to ask others for water refills and for the bill. No free chips and salsa but worth the $5 to get their salsa that had a heavy garlic flavor. Dessert was a disappointment which was the chocolate lava and ice cream. Small and not that good.",New York
ChIJlUTKy1VYwokREq7LLltPsGU,Isaura Lahoz,4,"First time eating here. I came in through the back door I guess, but I didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt the main entrance my bad. Two girls by the bar didn‚Äôt greet me nor guide me anywhere so I asked another lady there and she told me I had to ask the bartender then I asked them if I could seat facing the street, and one of the girls brought me the menu for the food only but not the drinks but Francisco was kind enough to bring it to me and he recommended GUAVA COCO BLOSSOM which it was so good. The food was excellent, I loved the nachos. Francisco was my server and he was so nice and courteous. I might give Dos Caminos another chance because I love food and the drinks were excellent.",New York
ChIJlUTKy1VYwokREq7LLltPsGU,Art Fernandez,5,"Stopped by Dos Caminos for a work luncheon.  Two of us orderred sizzling fajitas , other people ordered the birria tacos and steak/ cheese fajitas.  The chips and guacamole and all of our lunch meals were fantastic and it's a  beautiful location.
Thank you for a very pleasant afternoon.",New York
ChIJlUTKy1VYwokREq7LLltPsGU,Derek Beckman,4,"Dos Caminos is conveniently located in Times Square and it is what you would expect of a chain restaurant (if even not one). Food was fine but it was a get ‚Äòem in, get ‚Äòem fed, and get ‚Äòem out type feeling and atmosphere.  It is good if you are in a hurry and need some Mexican food but there are likely better options if you are looking for something more traditional.",New York
ChIJlUTKy1VYwokREq7LLltPsGU,NY chinchilla,3,"Came here for a drink while in the area. I had the watermelon margarita and my friend had a hibiscus margarita.
The drink itself was good but the watermelon used as a garnish was already rotting. The bartender was sweet enough to switch the fruit only for it to have the same exact problem.
Overall- good for cocktails",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Eduardo Gonzalez,5,Went for Thanksgiving dinner as is one of the best rated american cuisine restaurants currently. The menu was very well curated for Thanksgiving and I was completely surprised on the taste the manage to accomplish for the Turkey dish they were offering. The rest of the dishes were very good but no surprises there for a restaurant of this quality. A bit overpriced in my opinion,New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,S&R,5,"I went to this restaurant to see my best friend who flew in from California. Wanted a special evening to spend time with her and celebrate milestones while enjoying good food and drinks.

We did not have a reservation but were seated promptly after arriving in the main dining room. Michael and Kumar were our server. The entire staff was kind and helpful. My friend and I both got the prix fixed seasonal menu where I opted for the morning glory cocktail and she, the wine pairing.

Food was served at a comfortable and fluid pace. In total, my friend and I tried 10 dishes. The wines paired with the menu was perfect and explanations were thorough.

Food was delicious!

By the end of the evening, we were given apple crumble bread as to go goodies. The bread, even after two days, was still flavorful, moist and delicious.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,JunQi Zhai,5,"Came here for a birthday dinner and had an amazing experience! Upon entry, the staff were extremely kind and the decor was warm and inviting, decorated to mimic the fall foliage. They had an extensive wine and drinks list, but we opted for cocktails instead. The bar was able to make me a White Negroni that was spot on. The 6-course menu was simple but delicious, and everything was well prepared (a few minor plating issues but easily overlooked). My favorite was the duck; the most tender I‚Äôve had this year and the skin was thin and crispy. We ended the night with the birthday dessert and espressos. Overall great experience, and would certainly come back in a different season to see how the restaurant decor and menu changes. Highly recommend.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Brooke Pascarella,4,"We came in for our anniversary celebration and did the seasonal tasting menu + wine pairing. The food is, of course, exceptionally good but not the innovative plates I was expecting at this price point. For almost every course, the wine was poured a bit too early from when the food arrived which felt disjointed. Finally, the decor didn‚Äôt suit my taste at all, the fall rustic style felt a bit dated for nyc. Overall great dining experience at a Michelin star, New York establishment. Good to check off your list at the very least.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Greg Welsh,4,"Overall very nice and memorable experience in the dining room. Arrived a little early and table wasn't ready until 15 minutes past reservation time. The tavern was very crowded, so that wasn't a great start. Graciously offered complimentary glass of sparkling wine when we were seated. We added the wine pairing to dinner. Have to say the first couple of courses were very slow to come out. First dish arrived 45 minutes after being seated. Then it was like 30 minutes for next couple of courses. But our glasses were refreshed when the food arrived. All of the dishes were delicious and unique. The squid ink pasta was our favorite. My partner and I should have ordered differently from each other to try more things. Specifically I wish I tried the Norwich Meadows Squash. I preferred the lamb over the duck, but my partner was the opposite. I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order! Our server and sommelier were delightful. I fault no one for the slow speed. I think they were just exceptionally busy for the holidays and the tavern being packed.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Jerron St. Armand,5,"The Modern is a great dining experience and a fantastic way to break up the day when visiting MOMA.  I went for lunch in the dining room and had the 4 course menu.  It included the 4 courses plus the bread.  Each course was delicious in its own way, but the famous eggs on eggs on eggs really stood out.  The extra brioche is a nice tough too cause you'll certainly want more.

They have an extensive wine and cocktail list, and I was very happy with the affordability of the whole experience given how they have 2 stars.  Service was attentive and never felt rushed.  I was dining solo, so the extra little chit chat with me from the staff is always welcome (but never expected).

My only disappointment was when leaving, I didn't want to subtract a star from this since it was outside the dining experience, but I wasn't let back into the museum.  I called a few days earlier and asked if I could reenter from the restaurant and they said yes as long as you show your ticket. I had my ticket out but was told I need to go outside and reenter through the main entrance.  Well unfortunately it was pouring and the line was quite long.  Just be aware that if you're dining you probably won't be let back into the museum.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Rodman Rodriguez,5,A truly exceptional meal‚Äîperhaps the first true two-star Michelin experience we‚Äôve had in Manhattan (surpassing other 3* in NYC earned through celebrity and not substance). All around an absolute pleasure for all the senses.There were several twists that worked very well like bringing the bread after the third course. Another was the diversity of the servers presenting the dishes while still maintaining our head server‚Äôs role prominently‚Äîit felt very appropriate in a city like NYC. This paired well with the flawless composition and execution of the dishes and the serene yet sensory rich atmosphere. Two stars fully earned!!!,New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Brian W Piper,5,"Hands down, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I waited tables all through college and the service here was next level. They didn't miss a thing.
And the food...just magnificent. We did the chef's tasting menu and the wine pairing and it was expensive, but well worth it.
Not sure that we'll be making a return trip because of the price but it was something that everyone should splurge on at least once.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Sho Yama,4,"I like to enjoy a meal while viewing museums garden.

Gluten-free bread is fried bread and has a lot of oil.

ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Raynor Blom,2,"Review from a Feb 2023 visit. Massive variance between the price point and our experience for the evening. I've heard amazing things about this restaurant over the years but it would appear the changing of the guard after the pandemic has caused a noticeably dip in quality.

The service was objectively great, very attentive to detail and friendly/informed, no issues with adjusting meals for the vegetarian in our group. The interior felt and looked cramped in certain areas as the evening got busier. And lastly for the first half of our visit there was staff and maintenance working on fixing the AC, we were very cold while waiting for our first dishes and greeted with occasional burning/dirty smells while they were working on a fix.

The meal itself was good, nothing revelatory in terms of new flavors or ideas, just quality ingredients made well. For a few specific weak points - the truffle pasta special was just not worth anywhere close to the price, and the root veg on the roast special were under seasoned. Chocolate tart for dessert was excellent.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Tisha Mathlin,5,"Outstanding experience! I give them my outmost recommendation.
First, we had a special occasion to celebrate and we highlighted this in our reservation.
The receptionist carefully reviewed the reservation notes and seated us accordingly. Joseph was a gem and set the tone for the evening.
This definitely elevated the experience from the first moment.
The service delivered by the waiters were perfect. I mean it perfect!
The food was delicious and the drinks was refreshing.
To conclude, would definitely love to come again And I definitely recommend it.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Olivia Leigh,4,"Great atmosphere. An upscale new American restaurant with fresh ingredients. We had the duck which is really good and fresh and a large portion and then we had the steak which did come out undercooked quite a bit and then honestly I didn‚Äôt love that they just threw it back on the grill and it came out all different sorts of cooked throughout. The french fries were very expensive and very cold, so that was a bummer if I had noticed before I probably would‚Äôve sent them back. Good meal I‚Äôd probably come back, but the prices are high for what you‚Äôre getting.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Craig Smith Insurance- Specializing in Medicare,5,"My wife and I celebrated our 22 year anniversary at Gotham. We have been here several times.

ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Lars G,4,Enjoyed the setting and the extremely attentive and friendly staff. Professional Service at its best. We had the Tuna Tartar and then a varirty of mains.

ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,E Benjamin,5,"On our anniversary, we decided to celebrate at the restaurant of our choice. As soon as we arrived, the staff warmly greeted us, ensuring that our special day would be nothing short of exceptional. The portion sizes may have been modest, but the quality of the food surpassed our expectations, leaving us completely satisfied. Not only was the cuisine delicious, but the ambiance of the restaurant was truly enchanting, boasting a beautiful setting that captivated our senses. The staff's meticulous attention to detail further enhanced our experience, making us feel like cherished guests throughout the evening. Without a doubt, our time spent at the restaurant was absolutely delightful.",New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Albert Law,5,I really enjoy the food and drink from Le Coucou.  They have the best young chicken I ever had in my life.  The lobster salad is great.  The wine is also a good choice.  Thank you for giving me a wonderful time for my birthday,New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Patrick Hewson,5,Everything was fantastic. The tuna starter and the beef main course were particular standouts and will live long in the memory. The wine recommended paired perfectly with the food we chose. Simply put one of the best meals I've eaten this year,New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Vincent Li,1,"I didn‚Äôt have high expectations upon arrival and basically ordered what the waiter recommended. By the way, one of the waiters who served us was lukewarm and almost rude. He made his recommendations in a tone that felt more like educating, often using imperative verbs like ‚Äòremember‚Äô to start his sentences, which isn‚Äôt the level of service I expected in this kind of environment.

The food was still disappointing. The starters were overwhelmingly sour, with no other flavors to balance them out. The second courses were just average, which matched my expectations. I did like the maitake mushroom that came with the veal sweetbread.

For the main course, we ordered the duck for two. It came with the duck‚Äôs breast, leg, liver, and heart, accompanied by fig and mushroom, all covered in reduced duck juice. In a nutshell, it was awful. The juice was very meaty and poorly seasoned, so all you could taste was the meatiness from the duck and the tannin and astringency from the red wine. Also, the breast was dry and meaty. To my surprise, for some part of the duck breast, I couldn‚Äôt chew it and had to spit it out.  The foie gras was not too bad but its quality was impaired when covered by that meaty duck juice. We couldn‚Äôt have that so took it back home. The heart was also too dry and stiff. Then we found if you flip the duck leg over and look at the other side, it was disturbingly unplucked. Ugh.

I only came to realize this restaurant was Michelin-rated when I wanted to leave a review here because my partner had booked it for a casual dinner. This realization made me more disappointed with the quality and experience.

I do not recommend it. Try Aska or meadowsweet if you are into real good food and service.",New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Wei Lin,1,"I recently dined at this Michelin one-star restaurant, and I must say, it left me underwhelmed. I can only give it one star here on Google also ‚≠êÔ∏è because the overall experience was far from what I expected. The food lacked the excitement and creativity I associate with Michelin-starred establishments, resembling something you might find at a standard bistro in Paris.

ChIJEwHZcZNZwokR810IgyQhoZM,Mubin,4,"Stumbled in for some drink. Very cute french restaurant. Nice for a date spot. Was able to get a seat right away because someone just left, but you may expect a wait during busy lunch/dinner times. We sat at the bar for cocktails, this spot is your typical fancy version of some classic cocktails. Very spirit forward, so would be nice to snack and drink here. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the drinks at all, but may have had to try something different in the future.",New York

You can have it when you come back, because you will want to come back. That‚Äôs how good it is.",New York

Fried chicken is to die for.",New York

The size of the pancakes was huge, tasted delicious, we could not finish everything and was offered a box to take out leftovers home.
We had the refillable coffee and the staff never let out cups run empty, every member of staff was so helpful, friendly and polite, nothing was too much trouble.
I would definitely recommend booking in advance as it was very busy and people who had not booked had a long wait.",New York
ChIJETquaPVZwokRVYYGSKrg4E0,Sandra Wilson,5,"I had often pondered the reason behind the consistently bustling crowd at this particular spot whenever I strolled past. So, I tagged it on my Google Maps as a place to check out. Finally, yesterday was the day, and I couldn't have been more pleased. The cuisine was exceptionally delightful, the drinks were top-notch, and the hot cider was a particular favorite‚Äîperfect for the rainy weather. I must highlight that the service exceeded my expectations. Christopher, our waiter, was not only kind but also exceptionally nice.",New York

ChIJBXCQjxBawokRrxEiP2Idp8U,Marilyn Besasie,3,"Vegan Breakfast - Oatmeal w/ Berries, Fresh Fruit side, Breakfast Potatoes.
I don't know if this is strictly vegan because the oatmeal could have been made with dairy milk. But at least they offer a breakfast a vegan can order and be reasonably sure they're ok. If in doubt, ask. Sometimes potatoes aren't cooked vegan-style either. But this is the best I could do, and it was tasty and filling. The night before I did go in there for a take-out Beyond Burger. There was no one at the hostess stand, but I saw a group of servers further in just standing around. So I went up to them to ask for a take-out order, and one told me to go back and wait at the hostess stand. So I did and after a few minutes someone came around. The Beyond Burger was very good, so were the fries. Just be sure to order it vegan-style so they take off the dairy.",New York
ChIJBXCQjxBawokRrxEiP2Idp8U,Ellie B,4,"We ate out and drank here a good few times on our trip to New York. We managed to have 2 dinners (each time the burgers were lovely and very filling) and a breakfast (very large portions). The fries were extremely large portions at dinner time, could be shared by two people and alright to eat.
The atmosphere in the bar is fun, lots of sports on and different people around the bar.
Drinks weren‚Äôt overly expensive and for the good burgers and nice atmosphere i‚Äôd definitely recommend trying out bills if your in the area :))",New York
ChIJBXCQjxBawokRrxEiP2Idp8U,Juan J. Moreno,4,"Typical American bar, well decorated and with friendly service. We had the Ranch Hand burger and it was really very good. 100% recommendable. We also had the South Of The Burger, which was a little too spicy for our taste.",New York
ChIJBXCQjxBawokRrxEiP2Idp8U,Anon,4,"Food was amazing! Get the Fat Cat burger and you'll know why it's one of the, if not the best burger you'll ever eat. Just be sure to get it with some Applewood baconü•ì

Breakfast options are great too, with buffet style options in the weekend.

Service could've been a tad quicker, food sometimes stands waiting to be served a little too long. And waiters don't check on you as often as other restaurants.
If they can improve that, it'll be 5 stars all around.",New York

ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Andreas Apostolopoulos,5,"Romantic, cozy, and dimly lit Michelin starred restaurant in Tribeca that fires on all cylinders! From the ambiance to the suave service, from the starters to the dessert, everything was top notch! With a small seasonal menu, the chef doesn't fail to disappoint on any item. The ravioli were tasting many quality, savoring every bite. The duck with cherry sauce was among the best duck dishes we've had, and the chicken under a brick was 120% something to write home about. Absolutely elegant in its simplicity! I love to cook at home and it got me thinking how I could recreate something this amazing with beautiful ingredients! The ""egg"" dessert is a surprise, but it's like something out of a Netflix cooking show, spectacle and flavor in every bite!! Don't hesitate to splurge on an evening here!!",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Alycia Sofia,5,"Had a great experience here. The chicken under a brick was phenomenal. Definitely a sharing plate between 2-3 people, perhaps even 4 if you're light eaters. We started with the bread and butter. It was great. Loved the onion butter. The chicken under a brick was exceptionally excellent. Highly recommend. And we finished it off with the cookie and melted ice cream desert. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. Also best if shared between 2-4 people.",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Kevin Hirchert,5,"One of the best meals I've ever had in my life, absolutely incredible staff.  The GM Andrea was an absolute delight and a pleasure to visit with.

ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,Olivia Leigh,3,Nice restaurant overall. Prices are wayyy too high. The steak we had from the steak and eggs for brunch was minuscule but was good (very tough). Burrata was good only 2 pieces of bread for $22. Pizza was actually a generous size and pretty good more of a California style with a large crust. Also side is $4.50 no refills (I know that‚Äôs typical for this area but would be nice to see on the menu). Overall fine experience l.,New York

Green Zebra Pizza: Okay
Salmon: Overcooked
Artichokes: Good
Banana Cream Pie: Good

The ‚ÄúGood‚Äù dishes in this meal was the side and the dessert. Again, the service was wonderful, and this with the ambience made the dinner quite pleasant overall. But, given how many options there are in NYC, I wouldn‚Äôt come here again.",New York

We had the most lovely waiter who made sure to give us honest suggestions on our order so that we had a great variety.
The food was all fantastic - our main note was that all the protein was plated under a cream or sauce or toppings, and each plate we said ‚Äúwait what‚Äôs this one again‚Äù üòÇ wish we could have seen our food.
Cocktails were 10/10, I think we tried everyone on the menu, no matter what elixir we chose, the drink was A1.

ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Juan J. Moreno,4,"After tasting several dishes, all of them surprised me. They were not of my personal preference, but clearly were well designed and executed.  The wine list is impressive. Great service.

The restaurant is small and gets crowded, reservation is not mandatory but highly recommended.

Prices are expensive, as in any other high quality restaurant (and this one has a Michelin ‚≠ê).",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,James,5,"Absolutely incredible meal. Don‚Äôt hesitate to make a reservation. Every single dish was delicious and showcased the high-quality ingredients without strong sauces or complicated flavors.

The ambiance itself is lacking. While the space is beautiful, seating is crowded, even for NYC standards. The restaurant gets busy, so expect to be shoulder-to-shoulder with other diners.

That said, the food more than makes up for it, and I do highly recommend priotizing this restaurant over the many other options in the city.",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Eias Murad,4,"Stumbled on Estele while browsing 2022 World‚Äôs best 100 restaurants and the Michelin guide. Definitely worth it and didn‚Äôt disappoint. Vibe is casual, relaxed and hip with a small bistro feeling. Place is small and buzzing. Cuisine is new American with European influences I will say. I tried few dishes and there were all tasty and full of flavors. Highlight of the menu, Endive with walnuts and Fried arroz negro with squid and romesco. Cooking and execution was on point. You can hang out by the bar or grab a table with a date or group of friends. Good spot for lunch and dinner. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have some good crafty cocktails.",New York

The staff was so attentive and took great care of me. The host recommended the scallops with bacon, it was so delicious! Order this, you will NOT regret it. I ordered the hand cut fries, and these were some of the best fries I ever had.  I also had the short rib, with polenta and spinach. This dish was also very delicious, they give you a huge helping that I could not finish. The staff sung happy birthday to me, making my night very special.

ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Kevin Lubinsky,5,"A hidden gem in Midtown. Honestly just spotted it while walking and decided to give it a try. So many places to get steak in NYC, and we hit the jackpot here. Had a Seafood Chateau for starters. Great sampling of oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar, etc. The Tomahawk was perfect. And as big as my head. You have to have the DK potatoes. Trust me. Just order them. I have to say I am surprised that it isn't busy here at all. Shame. Lots of people missing out. Got a reservation just before I got there, but not sure if it is needed all the time. Hopefully business is booming at other times.

The staff were all awesome. Everyone was responsive and engaged and extremely friendly. Kudos to everyone for the great work.",New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Jennifer Meraglia,1,Came here on a date and the food was absolutely awful. Had to ask the server for a drink menu twice Felt like we were being judged and thrown in the back of the restaurant when it was completely empty. The pasta I got looked and tasted like dog food. The servers came up to us every 2 minutes asking if we were ready to order. Like let me relax. Now I understand why the lace was empty,New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Sitatham Puechkamut,5,"Capesante was my favorite dish; it was refreshing and well-balanced. Bombalani was uniquely delicious, sugar-coated donuts with pomegranate and chocolate sauce. The risotto was too salty and plain. Beautiful interior design with top service.",New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Denby Liu,4,"Went here for a birthday meal as Marea had been a place I'd heard about and kept meaning to visit.

Specializing in seafood we went heavy on the fishy side of things. Certainly the seafood we had for the first 2 courses were great tasting and had nothing to fault them on. The duck main dish we had was also lovely.

I was disappointed somewhat with the desserts though. I was hoping for similar quality as Lincoln Ristorante as I'd read that the head chef had moved over from that restaurant and always loved their desserts. Sadly, the tiramisu was a strange frozen concoction, not really sure what the pastry chef was trying to achieve there. The bomboloni (AKA donuts) was better and I probably would have been happy if I hadn't had a much better iteration at Casa Limone (and a better selection of other yummy desserts). Have it at that restaurant and you'll understand why the Marea version underwhelmed.

It was pretty heaving with people when we got there and the bar right next to the entrance certainly increased the hub bub. Which put me off as I prefer quieter restaurants, but unfortunately that wasn't to be as there were a lot of people there discussing business. Should have rung my alarm bells as one of the recommendations I had was from a sales person at work.

The decor is nice, but the tables felt cramped together for such a high end restaurant, the crowded bar didn't help with that feeling and that meant you could overhear a lot of conversations, especially the business meals. Don't know if it's always like that but it was definitely a turn off.

The other problem I had was that the dishes were just way over priced. The total bill was heading towards tasting course territory. And that was only with a few drinks, 2 of which were non-alcoholic. I suspect that was a consequence of it being a business meeting hangout and lots of expense accounts...

The ambiance killed the experience for me, loved most of the food, but once was quite enough for me!",New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Javier Kohen,5,All the food was amazing and the staff was very friendly. The flavors and the textures of every dish are composed masterfully. The dining room is airy and bright.,New York

ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Bredgy L.,4,"Overall the food here is good, but not amazing, especially for the price and the michelin star.

P√≥lipo - one octopus tentacle cooked beautifully, soft and tender while having that slight snap, and came with a balsamic vinegar reduction and tonnato sauce, providing a balance of sweet, umami and sour. Also had some sort of bitter green, sweet red onions, and roasted potatoes for completeness.

Fusilli - a tubular and relatively firm pasta, with a well balanced tomato sauce that pairs nicely with the beautifully cooked and tender octopus inside, with some breadcrumbs on the top as well.

Spigola - Seared sea bass with a green lemon based puree along with some green beans and a fried celery stuffed with a sort of cheese inside.

The place was bustling, so it took about 10+ minutes to get seated. The service staff was wonderful and even the chef was clearing out tables. The ambiance was great; A couple of blocks down from the 9/11 memorial and the Oculus, Schilling is housed in what seems like a carriage house of 1920s NYC, with interesting industrial touches and curious decor. There's outdoor enclosed plus sidewalk tables plus the street wall is actually a large glass garage door that was closed for the cold. Looking forward to returning when in FiDi.",New York
ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Abdullah,5,Fun spot in FiDi with very good vibes. I showed up at 6 on a Thursday and was seated immediately.

ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Sergey Butenco,3,"I visited this resturant with a friend of mine who is a huge fan of Austurian cuisine. We came here to try both schnitzel and apple strudel. Additionally, we ordered trout rilettes after getting a recommendation from our waitress.

Unfortunately, this food was below my expectations. First, the trout rilettes were so salty that we could not finish. The schnitzel was not crispy enough. The only thing we liked was the desert.

However, the ambiance is pretty good. You can have a nice time with your friends. Another note for the resturant is that they should find a solution for the outside door. It keeps banging and is quite annoying for the people having food inside.",New York
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Jomayra Jaime,5,Went to a company event here and the ambiance was top tier! The skyline views of century city are amazing and set for such a business professional environment. Bartenders and servers were all attentive and nice.,Los Angeles
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Doris Huang,3,"Overall, with this price, I was expecting a better quality. We spent a total of $850 for 6 people. Unlikely to visit again.
Service was great, very friendly servers. The style and vibe of the restaurant was really good, very fancy. (guess that's where I had too much expectation when walking in)
However, the entrees were very average to me. The sea bass/salmon I had: the tomato sauce is a very basic kind of tomato sauce, I can't taste the chef's effort. It did not surprise me at all. So did the salmon. Portion was way too small for an adult to feel full.
Desserts were better, they look amazing and taste great. Nothing to complain. Loved the 2 cakes in the pictures (sorry I can't recall what they'er called).",Los Angeles

ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Aimee Wilkins,3,"The food here looks incredible! Every dish arrived at my table looking spectacular.

To start, I had an off menu octopus special and the hamachi. The octopus was one of the best I've ever had, not slimy or chewy at all. It was grilled to perfection with a beautiful char and exquisite flavor. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. Alongside it I had the fish which was light and fresh in a tasty jalepeno ponzu sauce.

For main courses I had the duck breast and lamb chop.¬† The dishes looked fantastic, especially the lamb chop. However, these were extremely small portions. The lamb was all of four bites and the duck was four small slices, not to mention dry as well. I was definitely wanting for more with the main courses.

The sides however made up for the tiny protein servings. I had the crispy potatoes and the ""Hen of the wild,"" a plate of oyster mushrooms. The potatoes were the star of the dinner. They were a hit - hot, crispy on the outside, soft inside and bursting with flavor. They were soooooo good. The mushrooms were also really tasty.

For dessert, I had the funnel cake with berries and sherbet. The flavors were good, but the funnel cake was a little oily for me.

Overall, the dinner was good. If you're really hungry, I'd say go somewhere else. Craft is definitely more of a quality over quantity kind of place.",Los Angeles
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Geronimo Carlo Ramos,3,"It was a Wednesday evening, late at night, when my parents and I stumbled upon this enchanting eatery tucked away in a sleepy neighborhood. Owned by none other than Tom Colicchio, the culinary mastermind behind Top Chef, my inner professional chef and devoted fan were bursting with anticipation.

The adventure commenced with a warm, aromatic gougere paired with our $3-per-person bread, which though a tad pricey, was a sign of a sophisticated gastronomic experience. The avocado salad, rich and creamy, dazzled our taste buds with the unexpected crunch and flavor of spiced peanuts.

Sharing a delightful trinity of mains - wagyu pasta, Chilean Seabass, and a side of earthy hen of the woods mushrooms - we were enraptured by the flavors before us. However, an initial hiccup with the undercooked Seabass left us puzzled. Though the staff graciously tried to remedy the situation, we still found it tough to cut, despite its mouthwatering taste. Thankfully, management's gracious gesture of comping the dish left us appreciative of their care.

The ambience was a symphony of soft, dim lights and a hushed, intimate atmosphere, all while being serenaded by the picturesque scenery outside. While the service was impeccable, the food - although delicious - didn't quite align with the premium price we paid. That said, this late-night discovery remains a captivating experience for any Top Chef fan seeking an unexpected culinary adventure.",Los Angeles

Our server was lovely and gave us recommendations which were already the few we were torn between. I got the short rib hash and my partner got the basque eggs which was essentially a shakshuka with pulled short rib in it, both were absolutely delicious and a good portion size without feeling stuffed afterwards.

The modern mimosa is a must try, we were slightly confused when it arrived as it just looked like a glass of champagne but it was clarified orange juice, and was delicious! Definitely recommend it here and will come back to try the other brunch dishes too.",Los Angeles

The whole experience was truly amazing!",Los Angeles
ChIJKdvOsiTGwoAROdFrQHvqplE,Wendy Benitez,5,"This Michelin restaurant definitely deserves the 5 stars!  Above and beyond.  Exceptional service, interesting food and a nice chill atmosphere.   The highlight was the tradizionale ligurian foccacina.  Light flaky, flavorful!  The mandilli di seta was a very close second.. perfectly cooked noodles with a super creamy pesto style sauce ( not the traditional pesto, but all the flavor)",Los Angeles
ChIJKdvOsiTGwoAROdFrQHvqplE,Helen Hidalgo Mendoza,5,"Love the crostata for appetizer, my favorite is always the pesto pasta . Also the peperu is my favorite for appetizer. May God keep blessing this place and its owners . This is about my 5th time in this place . My husband loved the branzino",Los Angeles
ChIJKdvOsiTGwoAROdFrQHvqplE,Izzy,5,"We parked in the lot behind the building and walked over, didn‚Äôt know we needed reservations but they were available within the half hour. Our server recommended the Paradiso and 18K gold cocktails which were interesting! The gnocchi was absolutely delicious and the best I‚Äôve had thus far. It‚Äôs lovely inside despite the tight fit when it‚Äôs busy. Amazing food and service!",Los Angeles
ChIJKdvOsiTGwoAROdFrQHvqplE,Jose Valencia,5,"I've been to Factory Kitchen multiple times and it's always a great, flavorful experience.
This time we ordered multiple dishes to try.
The prosciutto is super good. The creamy cheese complements the prosciutto nicely. Also had the flatbread tradizionale which was very good as well.
Booth mains were great. Mandilli di seta home made pasta was cooked perfectly and the Porchetta was SO good, melted in my mouth!
Always great here and will continue to beat favorite stop for Italian food",Los Angeles
ChIJKdvOsiTGwoAROdFrQHvqplE,Neil Bhayani,2,"When you walk in, the place has tremendous promise and a fun clean atmosphere. The staff were wonderful. Unfortunately the food didn't rate higher than a standard Italian chain. The pastas were undersalted. Overall, the dishes were under seasoned and plain, but not simple in a glorious way. Just plain.  They wanted to charge you for a bread basket which just shows a lack of appreciation for their customers. With $30 entrees, your food should be fresh, interesting, and packed with flavor and fun.",Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Justin Bass,5,"This was quite possibly the best serviced meal I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of eating. And the food was incredible. We ate family styled and tried so many dishes. The highlights for me were the porkchop, the sourdough bread with truffle butter and bone marrow gravy, and the gnocchi. We also had the tomahawk steak, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and squid ink pasta. For dessert the upside down cake was excellent. The cocktail to try is the self titled Otium. Its light citrus flavor with Japanese whisky was perfect.",Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Sofi CB,4,"I would give it 4.5 but Google doesn't do halves.
I wanted to try a few things that in my opinion should never be removed from the menu or run out. However overall still a great experience.
We tried:
*Naan (amazing)
*Prawns (OK, we are used to great seafood and this wasn't anything special flavour-wise
*PB&J funnel cake (amazing)
*Steak tartare (OK, the base crunch was way too hard and there was not much steak vs other ingredients ratio)
*Gnocchi (really good, served a bit more greasy than expected)
*Pork chop (amazing, we wanted the duck but it was sold out for the night, this dish didn't disappoint and I would highly recommend it)
*Potatoes (prepared ""smashed"" style, delicious)
*Squash (good, but potatoes are way better)
*Carrots (delicious if you are ok with curry flavour)
* Samoa pudding
* Chocolate tart",Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Maria,5,The restaurant is a tucked away delightful gem. The ambiance is light & breezy with an upscale feel. The staff is attentive and the food was nicely portioned and cooked fresh. Price points are good for their selections.,Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Tommy Lei Studio,5,"Otium is an incredibly satisfying meal, albeit with some pretty steeped price points. We come here 2-3 times a year as a treat or special date night. Get the naan or Otium crispy potatoes as starters. For mains, the pastas are a no brainer. The seafood items on the menu are quite extraordinary and seasonal. If it‚Äôs available, get the heirloom tomato tart - simply sublime. Cocktail and wine program are very strong - but again pricey. This is definitely a restaurant to budget for, but so worth the splurge!",Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Mario Garcia-Gillespie,5,"This is one of my all time favorite places. We have been here 5 times in a year and will keep coming back. Everything is worth getting and the menu and cocktails are seasonal so there is always something new to try.

The newest brunch addition is great. Brunch is casual, grab a menu, order at the register, then grab your number and a table. They still provide table service for brunch and after brunch, hit up the Broad and a show and come back for dinner!",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,Beeta Z,5,"Most outstanding service I've been to in LA. When you literally walk to the restroom and come back, your napkin is folded. They fold... your napkin! They quickly replace drinks without us asking. A+ service. Now the food: DELICIOUS! The gnocchi was very soft and paired with the ricotta was perfect, and the bone marrow with the pasta was tasty (honestly thought they were green beans by accident). There are so many other dishes I tried and honestly, all are great. For the price they charge its worth it. Definitely come here for a casual get together or even events. You won't be disappointed.",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,What's dat ya brewing?,5,"It's one of the best places to visit I LA hands down. Service was quick and gave excellent recommendations. Kid friendly menu and everything was delicious. The drink choices were unlimited, and everything was cooked for perfection. Our favorite course was the bone marrow. It was a great start to a wonderful dining experience. The pork was well seasoned and  piping hot. The pizza was seasoned just right with a great amount of sauce. They also had refillable drink options, but not many.",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,Zina,5,"Bestia is a perfection. It was a perfection on ALL LEVELS when it just opened and years later got even better.

We can't wait to go back to this fabulous establishment.  Keep doing what you are doing, you are GREAT !",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,Avo Cado,5,"5 stars for the bone marrow and spinach gnocchetti! It was delicious and buttery. You can do a bone marrow shot after they scooped out the marrow.

Tartar and olives were both good.

Saffron pici, flavorful, a little bit salty.
Squid ink spaghetti, love the lemon, it was spicy and a little salty.

Bar seats are fun, you get to see all the action. Only thing is I wished the server would ask if we would like to keep the bread and olives before taking them away, there was still a good amount left and we wanted to take it to-go but it got thrown out instead.",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,Imaan,5,"An LA cult classic that actually lives up to the hype. Anticipate making your reservation far in advance, as it can be quite booked out.

I‚Äôm surprised this place doesn‚Äôt have some sort of Michelin recognition, as it is definitely at that level, in my humble opinion! Everything from the salad to the pizza and pasta was insanely delicious. We sat at the counter, which was extra fun because we got to watch the chefs prepping everything with such care and attention.

My absolute favorite that I still dream about is the Chestnut Agnolotti. It is easily one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve had, including everything I‚Äôve had in Italy!!",Los Angeles
ChIJg4Tqa7PHwoARrWA-2kwYfDE,Nabila Nawar,5,"The bar has wonderful service and serves the same menu as the dining area with a beautiful view. the stunning LA views.
$95 a person for a three-course meal. Window seating is walk-in only. Some people waited at the bar for an hour for a spot to open up.The experience was amazing from the beginning with the cocktails at the lounge.
Honestly, the food was well presented and tasted just okay. The fantastic vibes, high rise view, and night view are worth the money. The most important of all is the extraordinary service. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ç",Los Angeles

It is always made with utmost care. The service was wonderful. Our waiter was very patient & courteous. He was also attentive towards our order & drinks.

The drinks do hit so watch out *wink *wink. The ambiance is quite exquisite and makes it memorable. It is rare to get lucky to sit by a window seat so don't get discouraged if you don't. The meal is 95 per person for the meal but it also depends on additional charges for drinks & additional foods. However, it is your money's worth enjoying a night with a beautiful view.",Los Angeles
ChIJg4Tqa7PHwoARrWA-2kwYfDE,Valentine Chavez,4,"The view is magnificent. The service, outstanding. The food... the food needs work. Bread service was- crust was rock hard and wasn't cut all the way making it difficult to separate. Food was good but I could've been better. The place needs more variety for the first course. Second course, the ribeye was the best üëå. Champagne was delicious. All the servers were super helpful and knowledgeable of pairing the flavors with our meal.

ChIJG5wBgrfHwoARO_TfGQqe4xM,Hauuguu,5,"Thanksgiving 3-course dinner was delicious! We added on Mac n Cheese but it came with everything else in this picture. The turkey had a choice between white and dark meat, the cranberry sauce was nice and sweet, the bread they came with had pumpkin and cream cheese butter spreads, etc!

Only problem was the 30 min wait at the entrance even though we had a reservation, but they did come with some free steak skewer samples so that was nice.

Overall great experience, waiter was very nice too although he kept coming at the worst times to interrupt the middle of our conversation lol.",Los Angeles

ChIJG5wBgrfHwoARO_TfGQqe4xM,Robinson Mail,2,Visited Flemings on my b day for an early lunch customer service was great ! Juan the waiter was good .. I ordered the wedge salad it was. 10 out of 10 fresh and delicious the bread tasted old and stale .. the crab cakes were cold and lack taste ..the Mac and cheese was ok nothing special . The filet mignon was cold and looked old lastly I ordered the bbq shrimp didn‚Äôt like the taste shrimp were hard none of my food was hot and they had just open.  My ticket for the meal was about 130.00 and 25 $ for parking the view was nice,Los Angeles
ChIJc6BaWc3HwoARjoG2U9gMA3Q,Justin Bass,5,"This was an amazing experience all around! The staff were wonderful, engaging and had recommendations. The food was exquisite and portions aren‚Äôt huge, so it was easy to try many different options. My favorite was the tortellini in cream, but the butternut squash pasta was a very close second. The pumpkin olive oil cake and tiramisu were the best, and the affogato was perfect. The cocktails and wine were very good.",Los Angeles
ChIJc6BaWc3HwoARjoG2U9gMA3Q,Jasmine Lu,5,"The foods are tasty and the service is awesome. I like their chicken. The meat was cooked perfectly. Their pizza were amazing too.

ChIJc6BaWc3HwoARjoG2U9gMA3Q,Dory Benami,5,Amazing service and food.  Not a big fan of the homeless near this spot so be aware when driving and valet parking is $14.  The Michelin star is very well deserved.,Los Angeles
ChIJc6BaWc3HwoARjoG2U9gMA3Q,mike AP,3,"I was looking forward to this place as it had been on my list. The food was tasty with interesting flavors but just so little of it. I don't mind sharing plates but come on, throw in a few more tortellinis for $30. The wagyu was cooked nice and the cauliflower mash was very good but again that dish wasn't even enough for me had I been eating alone. I only mention portion size because not far from this restaurant is Brera (see my review) with slightly less expensive plates but infinitely more bang for your buck. My lady had the paloma and I had the oro kind of a gold rush/ penicillin but again, glass came not full. Overall service was great, everyone was nice. But overall an ok experience",Los Angeles
ChIJqbKnF0vGwoARREUrVhYGqTU,Nabila Nawar,5,"Beat view of LA
I would highly recommend having a reservation and requesting a seat near the edge.The service is top notch.. The Pei Mussels are small and the broth wasn't well seasoned.
The  Brussel sprouts are  very good. The Sea bass is the baked brie was so light and fluffy and the cheese melt was creamy with the brie inside.
The service was top tier, the food is soooo good
Perch is so overrated because of the views. Food was alright, they can do much better.",Los Angeles
ChIJqbKnF0vGwoARREUrVhYGqTU,Casondra Webb,5,"I love everything about this restaurant. We celebrated a friend‚Äôs birthday and it was perfect! The food is absolutely delicious, the ambiance is amazing and the drinks are flowing. The views are incomparable so make sure to reserve a spot outside on the deck. They had live music on a Friday night which just added to the whole vibe. Note: we did visit the lounge upstairs for a little while but I probably wouldn‚Äôt go back unless we had a bigger group and a reserved table. There really isn‚Äôt much seating otherwise. But it overall was a great time.",Los Angeles
ChIJqbKnF0vGwoARREUrVhYGqTU,Juma Nyumba,4,"Nice cute rooftop bar in downtown LA. Hard to find parking I think.
Friendly staff at the bottom floor tell you which floor elevator to perch.

Didn‚Äôt go for food. Went to get drinks on a Friday night 9pm. It was crowded on the top floor.

Crowd is mixed. Mostly 30+. Nice ambiance. Music not so loud for dancing and good for conversation.

Couches first come first serve.
Same as drinks. More of a crowd than a line. Bartender made our drinks nice and strong. Whisky sour was extremely expensive though i think it was like $25 so next time I‚Äôll order from the menu.",Los Angeles
ChIJqbKnF0vGwoARREUrVhYGqTU,Adreena Angela,3,"Really gorgeous LA rooftop. Cool, lush atmosphere with stunning views. Food is generally great, service is bad. The wait staff just seem to kinda hate you, which is a bit of a vibe killer. Alex however, was quite lovely, couldn't fault him.
Worth the bad manners for the amazing views.",Los Angeles
ChIJqbKnF0vGwoARREUrVhYGqTU,Malia,5,"I've been coming here on and off throughout the last 4 years. I've never been disappointed. The view is truly the main reason I visit and bring friends/family. Service is always great, staff are kind and quick. Food is a solid 3/5 for me. You can find better food around the corner. But again, the view of DTLA is worth it. If you do get food, the French toast is good.",Los Angeles

But I was very impressed with the level of great service from our waiter Carlos. He was on the ball the entire evening and made sure everything went perfectly smooth from start to finish. Genuinely good service by someone who has perfected his trade.

The ambiance is also great here.
The menu is delightful for seafood lovers, and we indulged in some lobster, crab, and a selection of oysters and other things.
Everything was done perfectly and tasted delicious.
I also had a steak (who doesn't love a little surf and turf) and they do them perfectly as well! (Oh and don't sleep on the chimichurri) overall a 10/10 experience.  We would definitely return.",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Marlene Viola,5,"Wow, What an experience! If your looking at reviews to see if it is worth a try... look no further. Normally I would not call eating at a restaurant an ""experience"", but this was extraordinary. Chris, our server, introduced us to the most amazing oysters we have ever had. I tried them a few times in the past (other restaurants) with no delight ... but these, Wow!  We also had the clams which were just as fabulous. The broth was delicious. Our main meals were the Chilean sea bass and a Lobster. Everything was fantastic! And we could not have had better service.
Even if you go for a few appetizers - go for it!!!!",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Judy Webb,5,"Every single aspect of our visit was exceptional!  Champagne was icy cold and bubbly!  Salads were ""tossed"" not doused!  Fish expertly prepared.

Not enough room for dessert but I would bet it was perfect too!",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Mario Garcia-Gillespie,3,"Dinner here was good, but come here for drinks and dessert. I did expect more than what I got, but that is part of the experience. The food was okay. I had expected more spices and flavor from the stew and from the seafood. The crab was over cooked and the oysters were not cleaned well enough or detached from the shell. The lobster was very good and cooked perfectly. They have a wide selection of drinks and desserts and that is where they shine. Drinks were well balanced, clean and high quality. The banana pudding was really good and that is considering I'm not a big fan of carmel. Not too sweet and a great balance of salt.",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Rissa H,5,"The water grill specializes in seafood, including sushi, oysters and several types of shellfish. I had the tuna poke to start and it was perhaps one of the best over had. Very large portion compared to other places. Would have been enough for a main for me. I then followed it up with the King salmon roll served with an incredible soy lime vinaigrette. This was very different and a welcomed difference. I didn‚Äôt have dessert as I was stuffed. They start you off with a sourdough bun topped with sea salt. This was again very good. I will definitely go here again.",Los Angeles
ChIJh9W-NkrGwoARmn2KQbXkdhg,Megan Rhoden,5,This was our first experience at a Michelin star restaurant and we were very impressed. The food was amazing.

ChIJh9W-NkrGwoARmn2KQbXkdhg,Shanelle S,5,"Michelin starred restaurant with a set menu for $125 plus extra for the wine pairing. Came here for dinner with my dad on a Wednesday evening and made a reservation online in advance. There were metered street parking available close to the restaurant, which looks a bit nondescript from the outside but is located close to Bar Ama. They give us extra plates and they were all so delicious. By the end of the meal, we were both so full it hurt (but it hurt so good). Below is what we had for our meal (though note that your dishes may change depending on season and availability):

- Chawanmushi - super soft and savory; a nice start.
- Kanpachi crudo with iced plant and citrus pur√©e and pluots - really interesting flavor and it was the first time I had an iced plant
- Squash blossom stuffed with ricotta and black sturgeon caviar with hazelnut and pink lady apple and Parmesan salad - nicely crisped texture and a fresh salad
- Angolotti wirh two types of tomatoes and Sicilian cheese and Tartufo - one of my favorite of the dishes; the tomatoes burst in my mouth and the cheese was so creamy
- Matai snapper in broth - my least favorite dish but my dad did enjoy its warm, savory soup
- Soft shell with aioli - both of us had this as part of our top 3 dishes, and it was an extra dish that wasn‚Äôt part of the standard set
- Wild sturgeon with huckleberries and Japanese squid ink - the final savory dish and it was a nice way to end
- Cornbread pancake with cotton candy grapes - another first for me, as I never had grapes in cornbread but somehow it worked
- Peach with marscapone and miso glaze: I wasn‚Äôt expecting this for dessert but it was homey and had a nice graham texture
- Chocolate macaroon - a nice little bite to round out the meal with high quality chocolate",Los Angeles

My favorite dish was the supplemental course. The menu said it had uni but it did not. Still not complaining, it was delicious. Reminded me of a risotto but with scallops and roe.

Service was also great. Really enjoyed the drink recommendations although there aren't cocktails. Everything pairs better with wine or sake anyways.",Los Angeles

Everything was delicious. I'm no ""food expert"", but I'd give this place 4-4.5 out of 5 stars. We got lucky and got last sitting for lunch (5 minutes before the closed).

There can be a long wait so I recommend coming during a weekday or lunch to avoid that.

ChIJAQDw5jzGwoARJ0ddsqWyCAQ,Ms. Pasadena Real Estate,5,"One of our favorite restaurants, especially in the Downtown Los Angeles area. Food is always so yummy. Even if you have tried hummus a million times, this place makes it just a little bit better. Our kids love the lamb and always gobble up the pita. Some of our other favorites are the grilled prawns and oyster mushroom kebabs. Cocktails are just lovely too. Service is wonderful and decor still looks good after all these years. If possible don‚Äôt sit by the windows when the sun is going down or you‚Äôre gonna get blinded, and the flies will be hovering over your table. Overall expect a really amazing dinner.",Los Angeles
ChIJAQDw5jzGwoARJ0ddsqWyCAQ,Wesley Cheng Erickson,4,"This used to be my favorite, favorite, FAVORITE restaurant in LA for many years since opening in 2018, and have been at least a dozen times, but this last experience was just okay. Food wise, first 5-6 plates that came out still hit home, but lamb flatbread and grilled dorade didn't hit the same. It's possible that our palettes were just overwhelmed by the first few dishes and our server seemed to be having a off night. Music was incredibly loud, which made everyone talk even louder, so it was hard to make conversations at the table even with an intimate party. Not sure if I'll be back for a while, but Bavel will always have a special place in my heart and I'll always speak passionately about this spot because of the owner/Exec chef/pastry chef, the consistency of the food/beverage quality, service and training from a hospitality perspective. 5 stars for basically everything and 2 stars for ambiance due to the music/noise volumes. I will always have so much respect and love for Bavel!",Los Angeles
ChIJAQDw5jzGwoARJ0ddsqWyCAQ,Jasmine Sabio,5,"Walked in late on a Tuesday night & had bar seating. Was helped by Sarah all night who was extremely friendly & was advising us on how to order the right combination of plates for the appetite we had. Everything was fresh, high quality, & perfectly seasoned. Enjoyed every bite of food & walked out with a good kind of full (not a 'having overeaten' kind of full). Ambiance & atmosphere was airy & charming. Great spot for date night or group meal.",Los Angeles
ChIJAQDw5jzGwoARJ0ddsqWyCAQ,Imaan,5,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in LA. The setting is beautiful, the crowd is always cool, the service is consistent and good. The food is what we keep coming back for. Everything is so thoughtful, from the fresh baked breads to the sauces made specifically for each dish.

You MUST order the harissa prawns. They are game changers!!!!",Los Angeles
ChIJAQDw5jzGwoARJ0ddsqWyCAQ,Rick Lupert,5,"We were lucky enough to score a table for 2 at Bavel ahead of a nearby event. We don't live anywhere near downtown so it's not an area we'd typically be dining in. Our experience at Bavel led me to the conclusion that it'd be worth heading downtown, just to eat here. It's a delicious destination with lots of options for vegetarians and an incredible amount of detail and artistry put into every dish.

We were seated at the bar in front of one of the prep stations, so when I say that there's an incredible amount of detail and artistry put into the dishes...it's not just because of the gorgeously presented food that was served to us, it's because our eyes actually got to witness it being prepared a couple of feet away from us. It was impressive.

My wife and I shared:

Malawach - I'm a sucker for malawach...Something happens when that deep fried bread meets that fresh tomato puree. It's magic.

Cherry Tomato - I wouldn't normally order a plate of tomatoes, but this dish was so beautiful and delicious. I'm a tomato convert. Let them be the stars!

Hawaj Cauliflower - hearty and generous in portion size even for 2 people sharing with other dishes. More yum.

Roasted Strawberry Pavlova - a dessert I just wanted to kiss it was so beautiful, and again really tasty.

Everything we had here was amazing. Things change seasonally so there's a constant reinvention happening, and some of the things we got aren't on the menu anymore as a couple months have gone by. But we would eat here any time. We couldn't have been happier vegetarians at Bavel.",Los Angeles
ChIJXVodUFfHwoARe63Z7LSuUnY,Sam Horine,4,Some of the dishes were amazing (shout out the pork belly) and some were okay. It was def super busy and our waitress kind of disappeared for a while but was fine as we had a larger group and were fairly self entertained. I‚Äôd go back - maybe lunch is a bit more chill - as food was good and I like the general vibe in the arts district.,Los Angeles
ChIJXVodUFfHwoARe63Z7LSuUnY,Gabrielle Bates,5,"Decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary here. It did not disappoint!!
They were excellent at ensuring my dishes were gluten free. I'm still dreaming about the beet salad. I loved the texture. It was fresh, flavorful and crunchy.
The goat fashion was one of the best old fashions I have ever tasted! I'm assuming it's because they create their own bitters. It had layers of flavor.
Salmon poke was fresh and an explosion of flavor. My husband loved the corn bread. The steak was cooked perfectly. It seemed like there was too much going on with the sauce and embellishments but it was still delicious. My least favorite were the roasted oysters. Nothing wrong with them. I think its my preference. I prefer them raw.
After dinner, we were too full to order dessert. The staff was aware it was our anniversary and gave us a scoop of strawberry sorbet. It was a perfect ending to a great meal
On a side note, I was thrilled there was not a strict dress code. It allowed me to show up in most of my Beetlejuice attire. I can't wait to return.",Los Angeles
ChIJXVodUFfHwoARe63Z7LSuUnY,Jeff Streit,5,"Girl & the Goat offers a fresh take on new American cuisine. The menu is pretty expansive and offers a lot of variety from green beans to goat curry. Cocktails are beautifully crafted and deliciously balanced. Wine list is extensive with plenty of options for the perfect pairing. Service is also top notch and extremely efficient. It's a large restaurant but it maintains a bright airy ambiance without feeling rushed.

Overall I would definitely recommend Girl & the Goat as one of the better options in the Arts District.

Plenty of parking available next door in the parking garage.",Los Angeles
ChIJXVodUFfHwoARe63Z7LSuUnY,Jeff McLean,4,"Nice location in the Arts District in DTLA. A lot of thought went into the interior to make it feel modern while being very comfortable. High ceilings and banks of tall windows that lend an airy feel. Service is friendly and professional, our server was helpful in navigating the choices of the many delicious options. We liked the roasted oysters and a very tender grilled steak that was amazing.",Los Angeles
ChIJXVodUFfHwoARe63Z7LSuUnY,Nicole Crawford,5,"I had been here in August of 2021, and I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt recall the cuisine being this stellar! It is other worldly!!!

Enjoy!",Los Angeles
ChIJXWulT0rGwoARFvjKPOWR40s,Ta Trammell,3,"Love this place for dinner only! Food is tasty, but portions are small. I came for brunch and the service was terrible. Dinner is a very different quality than brunch. Brunch service was terrible but dinner service was great. Drinks are AMAZING! You have to try the truffle flamb√© pasta at least once!

in a wheel of parmesan cheese. I really enjoyed this experience and seeing the whole show is worth each penny. It was not only tasteful but the pasta was to the touch. I highly recommend this place to try something new. And if you are pasta lover like me, you would definitely enjoy your evening. The venue is very pretty and they have beautiful decor. The staff is also very friendly and professional.",Los Angeles
ChIJXWulT0rGwoARFvjKPOWR40s,Nathalie Chan,2,"Came here to celebrate Bastille Day. Not sure if it was busier than usual or if it‚Äôs always this busy.

Initial feeling when we walked in is that it had a cool atmosphere - sorta John Wick vibes.

We came here to eat and watch the cabaret show. We had booked a table in the dining room (vs patio option) but we got seated off to the side where we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see the show at all. We told the hostess that we wanted a better seat so she led us upstairs. We could see the show if the dancers were at top of stairs but sometimes they were at the middle or bottom.

after we ordered, it took almost an hour to get our food - even the bread ! They said something about not being able to bring out food during the performances but 1) it wasn‚Äôt like there was a performance constantly going on and 2) we were off to the side anyway and waiters were going back and forth by us so I don‚Äôt understand why we couldn‚Äôt even get our bread ?

After that almost hr, the food arrived. The oysters were missing (they ran out but didn‚Äôt communicate that until we asked), the bread was room temp (but I guess I just assumed it would be warm) and the bone marrow had no marrow (my husband told them and they gave him a new one w more but he told me he has had chicken bones w more marrow). My husband said the steak was cooked unevenly so parts of it were raw (I think he asked for medium rare).

I enjoyed the tuna tataki and mushrooms. I never had escargot before so when I tried it, I was pleasantly surprised- it tasted similar to mushrooms.

Lava cake at end was good.

While the food was good, for the price I expected it to be better.

Not sure if the service was bad bc they were so busy bc of bastille day, bc they were understaffed  (or all of the above) or if they‚Äôre just always like that.

Our waitress was constantly running around working hard so I trying to be empathetic but waiting almost an hr for even bread that I‚Äôm assuming is already baked seems a bit much.

Ambiance is great tho. Great atmosphere for a date. If the bad service was just a one off, then this might be a good place to go. Again, food was good but not amazing which is what I expect for that price.",Los Angeles
ChIJXWulT0rGwoARFvjKPOWR40s,Michelle Hovsepyan,4,"We came on Bastille Day. They were offering a show that day along with dinner. While we had made a reservation, when we arrived, they wouldn't seat us because they said they didn't have any tables as their customers refused to leave even after being in the restaurant for over 2 hours. They said their was nothing they could do. We had to wait for a table to open up. After 10 minutes, we were offered a table that was not within view of the show and near the services doors. We asked to be moved as soon as a table opened up. After not. After not being served or addressed after sitting there for 20 minutes. We noticed an open table and got up and moved ourselves. Finally after being seated there for 5 minutes, someone asked us for our order, but not before asking how we were seated at this table. We arrived near 8:30 pm and getting get our food until after 10 pm. We were told the kitchen was backed up due to private parties. I begged them to at least give us the bread we ordered (which cost $7). They said they'd try. About 10 min later we at least got bread. I understand it was a busy night, I give them that. However, the way they handled their customer service was extremely lacking by the hosts. I've frequently come to this restaurant and even hosted company larties here, but I won't be back. The food is some of the nest French food in Los Angeles though. So if you don't mind the terrible hosts, the lack of care around a reservation, I'd recommend this place. Our servers made an effort though given what they were dealing with again once we were seated in an area they could see us. Definitely don't go there on first or second dates if you're aiming to impress your date. Do get the pasta with a show, they bring out a wheel of parmesan and mix the pasta in front of you.",Los Angeles
ChIJXWulT0rGwoARFvjKPOWR40s,Lucas San Miguel,5,"Food was delicious. I had lemon linguine and pasta was al dente and sauce was perfect, not too strong and not too creamy. I also had truffle fries which were thin cut and nice to include truffle shavings. I has cr√®me br√ªl√©e for desert which was delicious. The serving dish for it was a little thin which I didn‚Äôt like but the cr√®me itself was great and a good texture and the sugar wasn‚Äôt burned too much which was nice.

ChIJaUBtetO-woARqyrV4ASPECg,Zeno Lee,5,"We sat at the bar and it was a great experience.   Great atmosphere and service.  Everything was fantastic.

The only dish that we really didn't enjoy was the truffle risotto.  Felt there wasnt much flavor and though they put a very healthy serving of white truffle, I can't say I really tasted anything.

The uni egg though was amazing and the duck was also stellar!!!   Every other course was equally good!

Highly recommend anyone to go here",Los Angeles
ChIJaUBtetO-woARqyrV4ASPECg,Ryan Lew,5,"I went here for a friend's birthday and it was an incredible experience. From the moment you walk in, they take your coat and seat you before actually seating you at the table. I have never been served by so many waiters/ waitresses in my life. Every item of food was well crafted and balanced. Despite having multiple fish dishes, the were all unique from one another. Honestly, this is the only place so far who has prepared rockfish or swordfish to my liking. The scallop chip needs to be made into a regular snack because I would need it every week. If you need to go the restroom they will escort you there. Plates and utensils were changed out for each dish to enhance the experience. While this restaurant is pricey it is worth going at least once for the experience.",Los Angeles
ChIJaUBtetO-woARqyrV4ASPECg,Eyris Polzine,5,"I honestly can‚Äôt put into words how incredible our experience was here. From beginning to end the service was exemplary, the food was out of this world & the desserts were a true work of art. They are big on sustainability and reusing parts of food that are normally thrown out & I love that about this place. I absolutely loved how they personalized our menu at the top to say happy anniversary!!  If you want 2 star Michelin experience, this is where you need to go. You will not leave hungry I promise!",Los Angeles

ChIJITjJkkzGwoARXjwnGgDxtyw,Foodie Girl,3,"I‚Äôm providing a blended score of 3 based on food and service

The food brought the score up to a 3 as the service would have probably stalled this review at about a 1

Let‚Äôs start with the bad so we can end on a positive note

Our waitress was one of the most passive aggressive servers I‚Äôve ever encountered and mind you I do food reviews on a regular basis.

One member of our party ordered French toast which came with roasted potatoes. She also asked for a side of hash browns.

Server responds your food already comes with potatoes

My friend responds she‚Äôs aware but would like hash browns as well.

Server responds
You‚Äôre going to eat all of that food because that‚Äôs a lot of food for one person to eat

Entire table just stared at her

I then ask if they have coffee and if they‚Äôre able  to make a caramel latte

Server answers No
I ask no to which part
She responds again no

At this point it‚Äôs too early and I‚Äôm too tired and haven‚Äôt had caffeine so I wave over another server and he and I discuss my latte options

One of the girls stated she forgot something in our room and the new server states he can call someone to bring our items down.

Old server seems confused and our new server explains we‚Äôre in one of the top suites (added perk for me traveling so much and doing reviews) and it‚Äôs one of the nicest suites there

Now our old server is Miss Hospitality as she feels we now have money

Needless to say a caramel latte can all of a sudden be hand crafted and one appears

As the chefs have nothing to do with service I will say I had 0 complaints about the food. The food came out relatively quickly and everything was cooked to perfection.

The chicken and waffles was a fan favorite for the table. The chicken looks like chicken nuggets and we‚Äôre bursting with flavor. Dipped into whatever creamy sauce they  created and it was pure bliss.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich which arrived on super soft brioche bread and the bacon was deliciously crispy. I also got Tater tots and found myself doing a happy dance which sipping my latte.

0 complaints on food
Service needs some work

Perhaps don‚Äôt judge what people are ordering
Offer options if something is not available
And treat everyone the same regardless of perceived wealth or not

That human standard goes a long way when it comes to service",Los Angeles

Ambience was lovely, service was extremely slow, food was average at best.",Los Angeles
ChIJITjJkkzGwoARXjwnGgDxtyw,Gelli De Asis,5,"For dinner, I let the staff decide what they recommend. They recommended pasta with my choice of meat. Pasta is al dente, ingredients were fresh. I‚Äôve been to Italy and it‚Äôs very rare to find quality Italian food here in the US. So I must say that the chef really knows his stuff. It is Olive oil based so don‚Äôt expect a creamy sauce. It has tomatoes, olives, capers, and grated cheese on top. I got the steak as my meat of choice and it was tender and packed with flavors. They paired the entree with white wine‚Ä¶ perfect combo for the pasta, definitely. For breakfast, I got eggs benedict. Potato wedges tasted ordinary but the eggs benedict exceeded my expectation- eggs are perfectly poach and the hollandaise sauce was divine! Highly recommended!!!",Los Angeles
ChIJI7zsWrLHwoARIF_ifCX6mCk,Emily Trunk,5,"This is an extremely remarkable, luxurious restaurant. On top of The Westin hotel, this restaurant has stunning views of downtown Los Angeles. This restaurant does best with reservations.

Known for their steaks, I suggest their Filet Mignon. They offer it with and without sauces for those who have preferences or dietary restrictions. It's definitely the best filet mignon I've had in a while! Their cocktails and desserts are also fabulously made.

They are extremely accommodating towards any dietary restrictions, and our waitress was kind enough to explain each menu item to a friend who was having trouble.

Whoever is making the decisions back there is doing something very right.  The garlic mashed potatoes were immaculate‚Äîsmooth, creamy, flavorful, and buttery.  The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection, with juices oozing out.  The flavor was spot on and the pan sauce complimented the chicken wonderfully.  Only thing is the broccoli rabe was incredibly bitter, nearly inedible, so I suggest swapping out that vegetable.  The tomato basil soup was to die for, and if you get the martini, ask for blue cheese olives, because those olives were amazing.  Seriously, this place is legit!  They even had gluten free pasta for my husband.  The chef back there KNOWS what they‚Äôre doing.  Incredible food.  And I‚Äôm definitely a food snob.  Bravo!",Chicago

This is right across the street from Union Station, so it's always busy.  Their service is phenomenal, and the atmosphere is an old school diner vibe.

The food was good, but this is not haute cuisine. It's a greasy spoon, and it does so unapologetically.  The portions are humongous. No, really. They're huge.  It's ridiculous. I actually laughed when the waitress brought me my Eggs Benedict.  4 eggs? Really?  Ha!

ChIJESf9FrwsDogRbpAoMhuysOo,Peter Maliha,5,"Really beautiful restaurant with great food and exceptional service.

Our server was so friendly and professional. When she heard we had a long drive after dinner, she packed us a box of cookies!

The food was all fresh and flavorful. You can have half portions of any entree which made it really easy to try several dishes. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.

You get the feeling that you‚Äôre in a restaurant for business executives. Very cool vibe.",Chicago
ChIJESf9FrwsDogRbpAoMhuysOo,Chicago Local,5,"What a magical dining experience! Chef Jason Hedin has revamped the menu to exceed all expectations. His culinary talent shines bright at this metropolitan, city-center location. Historical lobby provides the place to meet before finding grand staircases to the east. 2nd floor restaurant has a beautiful bar & service staff was so warm to us. Thank you to Alexis for guiding us. You were lovely! Chef has turned the simple beet salad into a journey. The beef carpaccio steps easily over those abroad. Cornbread‚Ä¶ yes, cornbread, lives with flavor. Lobster & caviar pizza can change your evening. Heirloom tomatoes with a photogenic touch. Head-on prawns are drizzled with a sauce quite literally addictive to the tongue & the polenta alongside has been, foamed for textures sake. And then came the pasta. Linguini & clams were so fresh it was as if the purveyor pulled them himself that afternoon. Just wait until you realize what risotto can behave like with cherries & pistachio; it could change your life. For veggie lovers, and those who seek umami, the mushroom pasta has true passion cooked right in; the broth, ramen aficionados rejoice. Hiding under seared sea scallops is a sausage so succulent you could simply salivate (that was fun). Whole lobster has been halved & filled with a textual crumb before being beautifully roasted & plated alongside tomatoes on the vine. And then came the meats. My god, yes. It reminds you why Chicago is a food city in the 1st place. We understand how to curate carnal cuts. Spatchcocked chickens with a juice like you could never have cooked at home. The spare ribs were my partner‚Äôs favorite bite of the night. But then the beef. For me. Primal slabs of meat so well aged the flavor walks across your mouth for you. A 2 inch thick steak that needs no ruler or scale; all 40 ounces are obvious & accounted for. A behemoth & a beaut, sliced for the table. You nibble your lip while reaching for the closest knife. What appears to be the best steak you‚Äôve ever seen is now set within reach. Stab it closer to yourself. Truly enjoy it with sauces served to satiate. A French reduction in triplicate could be the winning addition to my already favorite bite of the night. The beef was better with it & I was already so proud. Every nibble of the evening was better paired with a wine. My lord, they have options for bottles. From $40 to $1400, your favorite varietal is found. Get a white & a red. Why choose? Let your worries wash away. When they walk in dessert you realize that we may need to be rolled away. Macaroons that pop & sundae served table side. He has recreated magic shell for your amusement. Panatone wins the last bite. A wildly spiced cajeta has something my tastebuds have never experienced before; I want you to know it as well. With that, we had to stand up & say goodbye to the best dinner I‚Äôve ever had. This is why good food matters. So we may have the memories & to experience life. Thank you, chef! I‚Äôll never forget this experience.",Chicago
ChIJESf9FrwsDogRbpAoMhuysOo,Dawn T,5,"Excellent place to escape the heat and noise on the street. The service was fantastic, with an attentive staff.

The atmosphere was so relaxing, the food was amazing, service on point, very friendly and attentive. This is located on the 2nd floor of JW Marriott off Lasalle.

2nd we went ordered spaghetti pasta and it was awesome only portion was little less. Pappadelle pasta, I didn't like much. But overall good.",Chicago

The server appeared to take our drink orders. The server soon took our dinner order with a great suggestion for exchanging out the gluten fries for a Caesar salad. All 4 of us tremendously enjoyed our meals. Our water did get empty a few times  but staff always appeared soon,  apologized and refilled. The bathroom was clean.  There is a bar area. Absolutely one of the best steaks I have had in a while! Even the Caesar dressing was so much better than normal.",Chicago

Try something different.",Chicago

ChIJv-CygqQsDogR8U__LLBxDY4,Michael Rowand,5,"I don‚Äôt often review restaurants and I‚Äôve never raved about a salad online. Nor is salad the first dish that comes to mind when you think of Chicago cuisine. But, my friends, the Watermelon Heirloom Tomato Salad here is heaven. Sweet Watermelon, peppery Arugula, smooth heirloom tomato, firm, high quality feta, and a tart vinaigrette. It‚Äôs just splendid. I completely cleaned my plate. The rolls are also very good. I appreciate the variety of flavors and styles offered. For those who drink adult beverages, the Old Fashioned was also delectable. The service was capable and the atmosphere at the Palmer House was vibrant. Whether you‚Äôre visiting from across the world or just stopping in after work, I recommend Lockwood and their lovely salad.",Chicago

We‚Äôd walk through and admire the beautiful old hotel lobby. Now I can come here to have drinks and sit and truly soak in the atmosphere!

ChIJrze1LlgrDogRAyf025kpMPE,J M.,4,"We had a great time at FireLake, with a more accurate score being 4.5. The ambiance was great, our server was thoughtful and attentive, but not overbearing, and the food was quite solid. Everything was fresh and tasty, with the farm to table functionality really elevating things. My burger wasn‚Äôt the best burger ever, but it was very good, even if the yolk wasn't over easy as I had asked. And the sweet corn was delicious. The highlight though, was the mega pretzel. It is a two-pound monstrosity that stands as probably the best pretzel I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a gimmick but it really works and the beer cheese and honey mustard that accompany it are both top notch. Things fall off a little with anything fried, as it all came off a little soggy and not quite to the level of everything else. The fries were boring and clearly from a bag and the fried fish had a flavorless batter that was just kind of mush after a minute or so. Also, the hostess, Fatima, was a little unpleasant, seeming actively startled by my family showing up and having a reservation and seeming hesitant to show us in. We were dressed down a little, but nothing bad. It was just not a nice way to start the meal. A little more of a hospitable approach would help. But overall, we will definitely come back. They mad the birthday celebration we had something special and the food really was above the norm. Just don‚Äôt get anything fried and you‚Äôll be satisfied!",Chicago
ChIJrze1LlgrDogRAyf025kpMPE,Ted Kim,5,"Came in for lunch Saturday and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Ordered a burger, fries, and a coke, and it all came out to about $20 before tip. Was not crowded and was well-catered towards the solo diner as it is in the Aqua hotel so there are lots of travelers. Burger was cooked perfectly to my preference and service was fast - received the food about 10 minutes after ordering. One additional plus I don't get to mention often is that I noticed that my clothes didn't stink of grease or other pungent food smells after leaving, which is typically what happens at other restaurants. I enjoyed my visit and will be back soon!",Chicago
ChIJrze1LlgrDogRAyf025kpMPE,Sandra C,4,"This place is inside The Radisson Hotel. The food was fresh and hot off the grill. The beer-battered cheese curds were big cheesy and crunchy.

ChIJrze1LlgrDogRAyf025kpMPE,Barbara Luke,2,"Restaurant kitchen horribly understaffed or perhaps still in training. In a great setting but extremely noisy. The singer was good but way too loud no matter where seated.  Waited 90 minutes for our dinners, party of 7.  Some food was barely warm, fish & chips overcooked; other meals mediocre. The baked corn bread was a treat though.
Our waiter was apologetic, manager sent over another drink for each of us without asking and most of us only drink one at dinner so that was a waste. Explained they were extra busy due to the Marathon. Hopefully they will get in the groove after more training.  Side note to manager: don't assume a free drink is what will appease customers; better to ask first and offer dessert or price reduction as options for the issues.",Chicago
ChIJrze1LlgrDogRAyf025kpMPE,Ben Ireland,4,"Food was pretty tasty! I had the roasted corn salad and my boyfriend had the (3) sliders / we split the Flatbread.

ChIJQedOdq8sDogREHQwVLBYcVU,Soyoung Park,4,It is breakfast restaurant for Virgin Hotel. Location is good while it's hard to find a parking space nearby. Their menu is typical American breakfast and their potato is so good! Pricing is not cheap but still affordable I think. Coffee can be improved. The portion was small and not really good coffee.,Chicago
ChIJQedOdq8sDogREHQwVLBYcVU,Agustin Bolivar,3,"It was okay, nothing out of the ordinary.

The server, Stoli, was sweet and provided good customer service. The food was alright. I had the Stuffed French Toast, It was sort of dry.

I would recommend more food options. I‚Äôll have to give this place another try to provide a fair judgment.",Chicago

The ambience was catchy. The only confusing part was the placement of the valet desk after entering the restaurant which I mistook for reception!",Chicago
ChIJMbRTOnvND4gRrup6n88Rwa4,DeVaughn Lane,4,"Overall Daisies is a solid restaurant that is worth checking out. The vibe trends to a higher-end cafe and non-pretentious casual look. The price point does not reflect the ambiance.

We had the onion dip with homemade chips (delicious dip with thick ridge chips that were a bit salty) and the brussel sprout salad which were both delicious. 8/10

We shared a gnocchi pasta which was quite flavorful though a little on the softer side of classic gnocchi. The flavor profile definitely blended between savory and herbaceous. 8/10

The highlight dish? It definitely was the pork collar. That was AMAZING. Tender, flavorful and paired well with the puree. 10/10

Overall for the table of two we spent +$200.

BE AWARE a 25% service charge is included in the bill, though this is noted on the website and menu.",Chicago

ChIJMbRTOnvND4gRrup6n88Rwa4,Ana Yoo,5,"I had the most amazing experience here last night and found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago! So very deserving of their recent Michelin Green Star. We got there about an hour before our reservation and decided to sit at the bar until our table was ready, and the bartenders were so friendly and nice with helping us pick drinks. I ordered the Aperol spritz from the NA section and the orange peel and grapefruit made the drink taste so much like an alcoholic spritz that I asked the bartender to confirm there wasn't any alcohol in it! The ambience inside was lovely for a nice dining experience‚Äìnot too loud nor quiet, and we were pleasantly surprised with the house music playing in the background (we love house lol).

When we sat down at our table, the food and service was excellent. We ordered the onion dip with ruffles and the focaccia with tripe as appetizers and then got the raviolo carbonara and the black truffle and chicken skin ravioli to share. Everything was amazing, and you can really tell Daisies puts an enormous amount of care into sourcing the best ingredients with the way everything tasted. I especially loved the tripe, which was the most amazing texture that wasn't too chewy or soft! The ravioli had the best balance of flavors and we really liked the hints of mustard seeds. The raviolo was also excellent and the lemon zest on top was a really nice touch! We also got the apple cider donut cake for dessert (no pic since we just dug in) which tasted so great and not too sweet.

The service throughout the meal was so great, and we really felt so taken care of. Our server noticed that we were a little cold sitting by the window and so asked if we would like tea, which was a nice gesture and very much appreciated!

In conclusion, I had such a great time at Daisies last night and can't wait to go back to try more of the dishes! Thank you, Daisies! :)",Chicago
ChIJMbRTOnvND4gRrup6n88Rwa4,Anthony Tong,5,"Absolutely get the shaved brussels sprout appetizer, refreshing and delicious. Also had the onion dip with house made ruffles as I‚Äôm a fan when restaurants do their take on common food items. Worth it if you‚Äôre into that as well.

Pierogi with mussels and garlic is A+.

Online reservations through Tock requires a $10 deposit/pp. This gets taken off from that final bill. Refundable if cancelled or changed within 3 days of reservation date.

ChIJs8mbNsUsDogRUnpg-b_IK5E,Sayak Das,5,"Girl & The Goat in Chicago is a culinary delight that I can't stop raving about! From start to finish, our dining experience was exceptional.

The restaurant's atmosphere is vibrant and trendy, with a rustic yet modern design that sets the stage for a memorable evening. The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic about the menu. Our server's recommendations were spot-on, helping us navigate the diverse options.

The standout feature here is the innovative menu. The small plates format allows you to explore a variety of flavors. We started with the wood oven-roasted pig face, which was a revelation - crispy, succulent, and bursting with unique flavors. The goat empanadas were another highlight, perfectly balanced in taste and texture.

The wine list is extensive, with an impressive array of choices to complement the dishes. The cocktails were equally inventive and refreshing.

The dessert selection is equally impressive; the chocolate chip bread pudding is a must-try for any sweet tooth.

Girl & The Goat is more than just a restaurant; it's a culinary adventure. With its creative menu, friendly staff, and a buzzing atmosphere, it's a top-tier dining experience in Chicago. Don't miss the opportunity to savor the creativity and passion of this gem. We'll be back for sure!",Chicago

We were promptly seated and the service throughout the night was great! Very friendly staff:)

We ordered the goat empanadas, grilled chicken skewers and shrimp and Gotham greens salad.

Was happy they had a gluten free menu.

Really wanted to enjoy the food but every dish was way too salty.

We had to pick out the crispy salty bits on the salad to try and make it palatable. We also left out the fried toppings on the chicken skewers as they were really too salty.

ChIJMViM4dssDogRdmIJH2z_Q10,Jiahui Zhou,4,Revisited after a year - easier to make lunch reservation now. Burrata e Ham is definitely their signature dish and the harmony of various different flavors and textures was memorable. Also tried the stuffed cabbage - interesting cuisine and was veggie cooked to give the heartiness of meat. One could see fresh pasta being made through the mirror - tried Tortelli di Zucca and Potato-filled ≈Ωlikrofi and liked fillings of both which were rich. My only complaint was that oil/butter seemed to be too lavishly applied to all the dishes (sans that burrata one) so that things became much less enjoyable after several bites.,Chicago

ChIJNYrg38UsDogRP1lxJuC05hw,Grace Lee,3,"We opted for a table, but they only got family style large ones for eight persons of each, so as a party of two, we ended up sharing. Small and limited space felt somewhat uncomfortable and awkward, hard to relax for being too close to others. Also I had to interrupt a lovely family sit by me to stand up and move so to let me out when leaving.

The lamb pizza was overly salty and lacked flavor (avoid ordering it), but we love chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates they were amazingly savory. You can order in half (2pcs) which is good considered we were getting full. The roasted baby carrots with hummus were decent too, yet the baklava was too sweet for my liking. The service felt rushed and pressured so I was surprised to see the default tip ratio on the POS set at 25/30/35% though our water was refilled fairly frequently.

I would say visiting once is likely sufficient as the overall experience is average and it‚Äôs not a loss if you‚Äôre unable to make it.",Chicago

The food is great, its so good I'm going to try to remake the polenta cause it was unforgettable! I loved the wrapped dates, so savoury and rich in flavour.

The best gluten free and diary free burger in Chicago and that I have ever had in my lifetime. They have beef and veggie burgers options; both are divine.

The gluten free bread is exceptional!

I have life threatening allergies and feel completely safe eating at Travelle. They take allergies very seriously and go above and beyond to make sure you are happy and enjoy the experience.

One time they made me a mango, honey, vanilla bean, almond milk smoothie‚Ä¶ it was so delicious they should put it on the menu!  I can‚Äôt duplicate it. It would be a nice sweet treat for the gluten and diary clients.

Travelle is located at the Langham hotel. I recommend a spa day there at Chuan spa then going to the restaurant. It creates a perfect day.

As a gluten and diary free person; it‚Äôs very hard to go to a restaurant and feel satisfied. It‚Äôs so special to me that Travelle cares about allergies and being inclusive for all types of people.

Thank you Travelle team and Mr. Zamora for everything you do!",Chicago

The Penne Alla Vodka, Eggplant Parmigiana, and mushroom pizza are my go-to. This place is open pretty late, so it's an excellent place to eat post-games! I‚Äôve been here for a few birthdays, and they can host large parties, which is nice!",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Vashti Faust,5,"We went to Quartino‚Äôs as a birthday dinner. I will admit, our experience didn‚Äôt start off great. We had an 8:30 reservation and had to wait about 35 minutes to get sat. We couldn‚Äôt sit outside due to a lack of servers I believe. Inside was very hot and loud, but that‚Äôs expected for an open kitchen layout on a Saturday night.

We got sat and could immediately notice our server, Julian I believe was his name, just got several tables all at once. The manager came over and was nice enough to get us started with drinks and explain the menu while we waited. We ordered a TON of half portions. It was so much food and every dish was better than the next. I highly recommend the slider, gnocchi, clams, and mussels.

Julian was absolutely fantastic. He made sure to constantly check up on us and even brought us over a little birthday sorbet (without singing thank god). Definitely will be requesting him out next time back in!",Chicago

The food comes out as it‚Äôs made and it is all fresh ingredients and hot! Added bonus being the food being very affordable and generous portions- again family style. We ordered 3 dishes and a drink and payed around $50 for everything- TOGETHER! would highly recommend and will be going again on my next visit!!",Chicago

And the pizza is amazing.  Or so thinks my husband.

And the salad with goat cheese and shrimp was spectacular.  So tired of frozen rubbery shrimp.  This place actually serves fresh shrimp and a great salad.

We were 5 days new to Chicago. Glad we found it. This place will spoil you and other places will pale in comparison.",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Lisa Whalen,5,"My husband and I traveled to Chicago for the holidays and decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. We are pasta lovers, so my husband booked a table at Quartino. The sign outside made it look a bit like a liquor store, and my eyebrow went up, wondering what the quality of food would be. The place is obviously popular, given that it was packed. They cram a ton of seating in the space, which made it challenging to get around, but curiously, it didn't detract from the experience. It was a well controlled hustle and bustle, like a large family trying to gather everyone together. Abbie was our server, and she seemed knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the food. She was very friendly and took the time to chat with us despite being busy with several tables. The portions were just right, which I appreciated because many Italian places in my experience sacrifice quality for a humongous plate of mediocre food. We started with the polenta fries, mortedello with pistachios, and gorgonzola. The meat and cheese came with candied fruit and an apricot spread, which were delicious. Our entrees were a bolognese and an Australian strip streak with broccolini. The steak was a perfect medium. The pasta was light, airy, and came with just enough sauce. Everything was super fresh and looked good enough to eat. We should have shared a dessert, but as usual, our eyes overruled our stomachs. I thoroughly enjoyed a coppa alla banana, and my husband devoured the hot chocolate cake. Either of these was enough for two people to share without a fight ensuing. We would definitely recommend Quartino and will likely be back for another visit.",Chicago

The list of food we ordered include: French Alexander, Boss Lady, Buffalo Cauliflower, Roasted Salmon, 14oz NY Strip Steak and ended with Chocolate Lava Cake! I can say everything was absolutely wonderful but the Buffalo Cauliflower was the best part of the dinner for us. I‚Äôve tried this dish in other restaurants and it never tasted exactly like chicken wings, but this did! I was amazed!

The service was terrific! We had Leo as our server and he did a fantastic job helping us decide, giving us suggestions, making great pairing choices. I highly recommend asking for him if you could!

The ambiance and atmosphere gives you upscale and bougie. You could pass wearing something casual but you‚Äôll fit right in wearing formal wear. There were people of all ages and occupations, and the dark vibes, and fireplace interior made everything perfection.

10/10 I‚Äôd come back again!",Chicago
ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,David Lee,4,"Pretty good food in a moderately upscale looking restaurant in the downtown of Chicago. There are tables and booths but might be good for smaller groups (8 or less). There‚Äôs some steaks, seafoods, plenty of sides and delicious sweet desserts.

Food
I came with my coworkers for a team dinner so I had the chance to try a variety of sides along with the seabass I ordered for myself. First off, the fish was pretty good and the meat was soft and not dry. Bones were not a concern and overall enjoyed the dish.
The burrata was excellent and trying the jam over the bread is a must.
The fava bean hummus appetizer was good as well and is something to get if you like hummus.
The meat and cheese board is nice to pick at but nothing too exceptional about it.
We got the hearth oven mushrooms but that wasn‚Äôt very popular at the table and we ended up not finishing it.
The brussel sprouts were well cooked and pretty good.
For dessert we had the panna cotta and the apple cobbler and I thought that they were both very good. The panna cotta flavors can be different depending on the season.

Atmosphere
The interior looks upscale and is very organized and clean. I did find the tables to be a little low though. The noise level was not too loud for on a Thursday evening and I could hear people across the table. Good place to come celebrate or just have a nice dinner.

Pricing
The prices are average for this type of upscale restaurant, but a little bit more expensive if you had chosen to get these foods at a more casual place. The price was worth the food.

Service
I have mixed things to say about the service. We had made a reservation for our group of 10 people but when we arrived they had tried to seat us at 2 separate tables for our team dinner. We didn‚Äôt request this but then eventually they were able to accommodate us and seat us all together. Otherwise, the service was good and taken care of promptly.

ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,Amanda,2,"Literally awful! The main restaurant looked so fun and pretty and lively. We made a reservation but were sent up a narrow staircase to what is basically a hotel lobby. Dark, bland, and uninviting. Sat next to a dark room and a table full of kids who ran around and were loud and disruptive. Our waiter was MIA 90% of the time. Our food came out cold. I got the Buffalo cauliflower and it was super cold and soggy - I mean COLD, and unappetizing. I wanted it to be reheated, but again, our waiter was nowhere to be found. By the time I was able to ask for it to be heated up, everyone else was about done eating. Our drinks remained empty and our water, gone. Literally couldn‚Äôt get WATER. Come on. Only thing I enjoyed were the biscuits. Would not recommend AT ALL.",Chicago

I took my business colleagues from out of town here for lunch and everyone thought the food was really good.  I had the burger and fries and my colleagues had a fried chicken sandwich and a reuben sandwich and all were good.

ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Nicholas P,5,"No reservations. First come first serve. When we came we were seated right away by the kitchen. Does it live up to the hype and is it the best burger I ever had in my life? No not really because I‚Äôve had a lot of burgers in my life.

ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Peter Farejowicz,5,"Au Cheval is another Chicago icon slinging out it‚Äôs popular gourmet burgers and fries. Been meaning to try this place for so long and finally had a chance to visit.

I ordered the go to of many people which is the single cheeseburger but added the egg and bacon on top. Don‚Äôt be confused, the single is actually a double and the double is actually a triple so plan accordingly. The meat was well prepared but the extras of egg and bacon really made the burger. The bacon was thick cut and seasoned perfectly. Everything melted in your mouth. I‚Äôd definitely eat this burger again but be aware, it is pricey so it‚Äôs definitely a splurge compared to something like In-n-Out which tastes equally as delicious.

Service was fantastic. Our waiter was great and even brought us an order of fries with egg and sauces on the house that we didn‚Äôt order so I was impressed.",Chicago

I was so full but couldn‚Äôt stop eating the hash brown‚Ä¶ like, amazing. And dessert was just gluttony but absolutely worth it. I ended up sharing with someone sitting next to me and our server Spencer said it was on the house! Like, 10/10 experience!

The only but is the line system at the entrance door is a bit confusing and everyone is jamming at the entrance which I found a bit overwhelming.",Chicago

We love seafood. The oysters, shrimp and lobster claws/tails were endless. Moving on to the steak section. There was skirt steak and tomahawk. I got a piece of the tomahawk to try and it was delicious. I was more focused on the seafood (lol). They had a pasta station with fresh pasta and risotto. If you get the risotto, they offer truffle shavings on top. Delicious! These were the stations out in the entrance area.

Inside they had some veggie sides, cheese spread, pastries, desserts, and bread. The desserts were so good. The detailing of it plus I enjoyed most of them being just 1 bite.

ChIJa4wxF4O22YgRhBavPpUCs3s,Jonathan Kou,3,"Great place in the heart ‚ô•Ô∏è of brickell. Atmosphere was great and the restaurant very nice rustic style. Food was ok, I ordered the new york steak medium rate and it was nothing out of the ordinary, i can even say it was too dry for a steak house. The service took too long to take our order and they were never alert if we needed something else or asked if everything was ok. The restrooms are like 2 miles away on another floor. Salad was good, and gambas too, drink ok. For the price i could have expected at least better service.",Miami
ChIJa4wxF4O22YgRhBavPpUCs3s,Maria Klann,5,"Everything is so great about this place.
As soon as you arrive, you feel a nice atmosphere, modern and a unique design. It's very cozy, warm and romantic.

The sweet hostess received me with kindness and with a big smile.

The waitress was very professional, friendly and happy; he took his time to give suggestions about the menu.

The quality of food is very good and also the flavor. The executive menu is not expensive at all for this type of place.

Nice and long bar.

Quinto is located inside the Brickell City Centre. You can park in the mall and go to the fifth floor. Make sure downstair that you‚Äôre in the right tower.

Pet friendly.

I will repeat it again! I like it a lot!",Miami
ChIJa4wxF4O22YgRhBavPpUCs3s,Hector C.H,5,"Very nice place, the decoration and the view are spectacular, the attention was first class, excellent service, I divided the food into two opinions, the starters were ok, but the main course, both meat and chicken, were spectacular, the flavor and Very good presentation, highly recommended",Miami
ChIJFzRdgIG22YgRC6upJNXH__8,Carmelo Stanco,5,"I recently dined at Ca√±a, a hidden gem tucked away on the 2nd floor of the Hyatt, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of amazing. The food at this Cuban restaurant exceeded all expectations. From the moment I walked in, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made me feel right at home.

The menu at Ca√±a offers a delightful array of Cuban dishes that are bursting with flavor. I couldn't resist trying their traditional Cuban sandwich, which was a perfect blend of tender roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard on crisp Cuban bread. Each bite was a taste of heaven.",Miami
ChIJFzRdgIG22YgRC6upJNXH__8,Kaitlyn Irwin,5,"Found this restaurant on a whim while away for a wedding anniversary/babymoon trip with my husband. We went on a Sunday night and it was farely empty which worried me at first but they did not disappoint! From the service to the food quality/flavor, I was impressed. According to my husband it was the best meal he had all trip. I don't know if I would say all that but it was very delicious. I had the garlic shrimp appetizer as a meal with maduros and he had the Vaca frita (came with rice and beans) and we split the truffle fries. Even our drinks were outstanding! His a rum punch and mine a guava mule* (I'm pregnant so I asked for the drink with no alcohol and was told they carried Ritual Zero Proof Tequila! It was an amazing mocktail!) We were too full for dessert but ended our night with a glass of bubbly to celebrate (I had sparkling cider). When ever we return to Miami, this will definitely be a stop.. maybe for brunch next time.",Miami
ChIJFzRdgIG22YgRC6upJNXH__8,Michael Rinkner,5,"A bit hidden (on the 2nd floor of the Hyatt) and not very crowded (which is a Plus). Stylish Interior. The service is fast and very friendly. Cheese Balls are amazing. Tomato with Cheese (somehow related to the Italian Caprese) was very delicious too. ""Unfortunately"" there were too many options i could not try but its definitely worth another visit.",Miami

ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Kevin K. Francis,5,"We had a party of six and when our entire party arrived, we were seated promptly. The food was excellent and the entrees included appetizers. We were there during happy hour which we all would highly recommend! The only reason I rated the atmosphere with 4 stars was due to the problems the staff had with the thermostat. Although the manager addressed it, it was a little uncomfortable during our dining experience. We were encouraged to put our phones in a little box in the middle of the table to help us enjoy each other and not social media. It was a nice touch! The bill came in a locker which was different but we found it to be a cool conclusion to our evening.",Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Orane Williams,5,Celebrated my father's birthday. Prior I was in communication with the events team for my reservation. The communication was great and any questions and concerns I had was addressed. Day of the event although the Host team didn't have my group in the computer my table was prepared prior. My server introduced himself to me and went through things. My family enjoyed the food and service we received. My father enjoyed his birthday dinner with his family at this restaurant. The team presented him with a personalized complimentary bottle of wine to commemorate his birthday.,Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Morgan Ackley,5,"Alex is a fantastic server. Very attentive to fill up cava and water as needed. He informed us of daily specials and lunch recommendations. The food was very fresh, all produce, fish, croquettes, salads etc  seemed extremely fresh and locally sourced. The presentation and plating is also impressive for the price point (which felt very accessible for the area). On top of that, the outdoor patio offers breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay. Thank you, Alex!",Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Mason Thornburg,4,We really enjoyed the experience and the food was great. I can't leave a 5 star because the attention to details was not there. It was my wife's birthday and I spoke to them prior to our visit and wanted the cake to come out and say happy birthday on the plate. I spoke to them while we were there about the cake and told them who she was at the table. The cake came out and no happy birthday written on it. Kinda ruined the moment. Other than that the place was great. I attached a pic of the cake after we started eating it.,Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,A. Love,5,"The food, atmosphere, ambiance, and service were right on point. They seated our large group in the back, which was great. We were able to walk in and out to take pictures for my friends birthday, but try locked it once we began to eat so other customers would not continue to use the door to enter and exit. It's an all-around great restaurant to experience.",Miami

ChIJuYnp5vu22YgRqjNB5POHQPg,Dharmisha Mistry,5,"This was a different type of burger, patty was nice and tender and frita was just beyond amazing. Very crispy and not at all oily. Staff was very welcoming too, everyone does not talk in English but a couple of them do and they would take good care of tourists that cannot speak Spanish. Definitely should try this burger once when you‚Äôre in Miami. üòä",Miami
ChIJuYnp5vu22YgRqjNB5POHQPg,Warren P.,5,Some the most authentic Cuban food in the greater Miami area - I had the steak sandwich with frites and it did not disappoint. The service was also fantastic and the prices are very reasonable. The location is very close to central Little Havana and it‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúmust try‚Äù if you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood.,Miami
ChIJuYnp5vu22YgRqjNB5POHQPg,Yessie Herrera,5,"This place is in a strip mall and not a fancy place, but the food is a real great experience with genuine taste of Cuban food, and at a fair place. We recommend any Cuban Frita because the meat has a delicious special taste and the size is just good for lunch. The Frita Suprema is incredible, but you can customize the frita however you like. In general, they do not offer many dishes but those available are delicious and prepared with high quality ingredients! A plus: staff are amazing and this place is located in Little Havana, ideal to go for a cultural walk afterwards!",Miami
ChIJG2-9xp222YgRJ_Dqby74tmg,Julianna Capobianco,5,"One of the best spots for brunch in Miami, hands down! Cafe Bastille never disappoints. The food, bakery items, and drinks are consistently delicious. The first time that we went to Cafe Bastille the food, service, and vibes were so amazing that we canceled our reservation for the following day and went back for more. We just recently went back again and it was even better than we remembered. Everyone who works there is so kind, attentive, and dedicated to quality customer service. Although you are not able to make a reservation in advance I do not think we have ever waited over 20 minutes (on the weekend). The DJ who plays outside is so fun and friendly he for sure adds a little something special to the experience! Every time we are in Miami we have to go to Cafe Bastille and whenever someone asks for a recommendation this is the first and only place I will recommend. Can't wait to go back!",Miami
ChIJG2-9xp222YgRJ_Dqby74tmg,Eva Hernandez,3,The best avocado toast! so tasty and simple. The only downside is that you have to wait for 20 minutes to get a table plus the time to get your food. Go if you have time to spare and not very hungry,Miami
ChIJG2-9xp222YgRJ_Dqby74tmg,Adam H,5,Amazing breakfast place within walking distance of our hotel. I had the Mediterranean omelette and it was fantastic. Everyone else loved their food as well.

Victor was our server and was so amazing. He had amazing rapport with everyone and was very attentive.

We tried several items, chicken, filet, NY strip, salmon, Calamari, and our favorite by a mile, Sticky Toffee Pudding. The chefs left us a signed note for our anniversary, which was a nice tough.

The ambiance was perfect and we are very happy to have made this our dinner. 10/10 would come back.",Miami
ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,M Velez,5,Had a wonderful Thanksgiving brunch.. our waitress Cynthia was AMAZING. She walked us through every step of the menu with many recommendations.

ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,Brian Seymour,5,We visited for our anniversary and were not disappointed. Our waitress Valentina was wonderful. We followed all of her recommendations. We started with the grilled octopus. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Risotto and my wife had the grouper. The meal ended with a chocolate lava cake that was divine.

ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,Julie Moran,5,"First of all the views are out of this world! The food was also fresh, inventive and very delicious. Melissa was a wonderful server.

ChIJY-3KAZ-22YgR7TAs_Qzoad4,Bobby Jackson,4,"I visited this place prior to the the Heat game against the Milwaukee Bucks. I had some time to kill.

It's a pretty standard hotel bar with guests walking in and out. It's right near the main entrance, so it's pretty loud and right in the center of patrons checking in and out.

They had some craft beers on the menu, so I happily ordered a Wynwood Brewery Ale. Service was solid. I also ordered chicken tacos, which were delicious (see pics).

On this particular day, the Women's March at Bayfront Park added higher than usual excitement to the bar area. I was engaged in a really solid conversation with a young lady who participated in that event, and she provided a play by play account. Very pleasant conversation.

It should be noted that hotel bars are the best places to meet interesting folks. I enjoyed my visit here and consider it to be viable option prior to Heat games.",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Robert Hill Jr.,5,"Beautiful restaurant. My wife and I‚Äôve been wanting to go for a while, and this was our first outing after our son was born.

ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Ismonde Guillaume,4,"Chica Miami was nice. I love the earthly colors and the paintings and plants. It took a while for the food to come out, but the food was pretty good. I saw the section for the live band, but they were not there when we were there. A little background music would have helped pass the time. As we waited for our food, my friends and I took some pictures. I rate it 4/5. I would like to go back and see the live band and entertainment",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Cecily B,5,"Came to CHICA for a birthday brunch and we were all blown away. Our server was Jenn and she was AMAZING. She payed close attention to details and really made our experience so enjoyable.

Thank you Jenn! We will be back soon 100%",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Nicole Martinez,4,"This was our first time brunching here. We came for a birthday with a group of 12 and we were accommodated easily with a reservation. The ambiance and decor is nice.

Sunday they had bottomless mimosas for $36 per person. The food was delicious, but some of the plates were small.

The Paisa Breakfast Bowl specifically was amazing, I forgot to take a picture of it, but for $25 I was hoping it would be a shareable size. I would still buy it again.

The timing of the plates was a bit off - the first plate came before the drinks and then they all came together but took some time.

They included the Pistachio Cinnamon Rolls and a round of shots for free since we were celebrating  a birthday. Sky was our waitress and she was very nice and attentive.

I‚Äôve also been here for a date night and for dinner and I loved their unique menu, this spot is awesome and I definitely recommend it!",Miami
ChIJd6C8AYO22YgRYuO-L2IUdDQ,Jaye Aster Broder,3,"Remember if you go here that they won‚Äôt seat you until everyone in your party is present. The dinner vibes are nice and more chill than the later scene. We enjoyed the cocktails here. Portions here are quite small, even for things like fried rice. The soy salmon was popular at the table. We don‚Äôt think the sea bass is worth it. The fried chicken was good but not like Korean fried chicken that I‚Äôve had. The restaurant does a nice job of ordering and serving food quickly.
We disliked how there was a bathroom attendant with a QR code for Venmo/cash app but a completely broken soap dispenser and wish that the restaurant would pay to repair the dispenser rather than pay someone to stand in the bathroom to hand you paper towels.",Miami
ChIJd6C8AYO22YgRYuO-L2IUdDQ,Joshua Yancey,4,"Extremely excited and looked forward to eating here for my wife‚Äôs birthday. All of our dishes were spectacular, the server and all the crew were very nice and on top of things. Let me be clear, I was happy, my wife was happier.

This is Miami, so I know how things work with an establishment that‚Äôs very popular and busy. I have one small issues and just a heads up to future guests.

They do play music inside (I‚Äôm very aware that they have a lounge/dance area) it can be somewhat loud. I‚Äôm never a fan of having to talk loud while eating at any place upscale.

Again, this place is great, it‚Äôs also very busy. If you are wanting a relaxing, take your time restaurant ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt it. Again it‚Äôs Miami, it‚Äôs Brickell. I know what I‚Äôm getting, and ultimately was pleased.",Miami
ChIJd6C8AYO22YgRYuO-L2IUdDQ,Rmolina1026,3,"OK, so Komodo wasn't what I expected it to be. Loved the vibe and atmosphere. The food taste wise was good. I can't complain about the taste. But...the portions to price ratio is out of hand. The pictures are probably bigger than what the items actually were. I get they were small plates or starters but damn.... I was told that the steak I had, even though it was not labeled as such, I was told it was filet mingon. I doubt it thought. Still tasty but I paid a lil less for an actual filet mingon at mortons and it was awesome. The dumblings were the size of 2 dollars worth of quarters maybe smaller. I get there are places that serve tint portions like this but komodo is not one of those places. Drinks are over priced as well. Like I paid 20 bucks a pop for a Jack and coke...... A jack and coke. I understand their specialty cocktails all day every day. But Jack and coke??? I was shocked. When 2 of those and 2 redbull vodkas (titos) were over 80bbucks alone. I'm not cheap by any means but it's kind of a rip.
Aside from that, this place had great decor, it was sexy, and just had a great vibe. We ended up going to the lounge after where they tried to charge all the guys 100 bucks a pop. We literally told them we just spent a lot of money downstairs and they let us go through after the manager said it was cool. But $100??? Come on be real. Not even LIV charges that much. It was a fun (little)lounge. There are nice things to this place but it honestly feels like a cash grab. It's hard for me to recommend this place. OK experience but the price of things aren't justified. I felt like I got bent over. And I hate feeling that way after trying a new spot. Especially one that is considered ""higher end"" I've been in real high end spots that didn't charge as much as they do. But if you do try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the flavors. Good luck.
Oh, almost forgot. The wait staff was good, no issues there But!!!! This irked me so much. We had a big group. And they only let u split it by 3 groups. They should really train the staff to say that at the beginning. Or when we make reservations to mention that or if they do it online that they have a notice saying they don't split bif groups. It was such a mission.",Miami
ChIJd6C8AYO22YgRYuO-L2IUdDQ,Saneika Stewart,5,"Don‚Äôt choose a late reservation on a Saturday if you don‚Äôt want to wait. We went on a Saturday night. Had 10:30pm reservations (we were late got there at 10:45 ish) we got seated at 12am, you must be wondering (why are you giving them a 5 star review ) it was worth the wait.
The bar downstairs is great to get drink and relax until your table is ready. We had about close to 60 people waiting with us. (No one argued). Our food was delicious. The service was amazing, they have 3 floors and a short but cute dragon show. Would go back at an earlier time to experience it without the wait.",Miami

Food was very good tho!",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Josh Friedlander,5,"Exceptional food. The oysters are a

My boyfriend said he‚Äôd come back here for their bavette steak rather than go to a steakhouse, it was THAT good! He even ate the artichoke which is a miracle! Everything was delicious.

ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Holmes Beltran,5,"Finally made it here after a long time wanting to come.
This place is so easy to miss when you're driving or even walking so thank god for Yelp these holes in the wall are found. I also found an article on the Miami New Times about the owner and Chef and was surprised that this is Spanish food, Catal√°n to be specific but more of a playful take on it, says the article.
I came here to try the infamous Today's Rice dish which is Chef inspired and therefore changes daily.
Today's it was made with clams and it did not disappoint at all. The dish is basically a rice with the delicious broth and whatever seafood protein they add that day. Rice is cooked perfectly, with kind of a risotto consistency and it comes in a metal pot. I just couldn't get enough of it because it was that delicious and the clams were very flavorful and most importantly, fresh. Although the dish looks small when you first see it, it's not small at all. Next time I'd love to try the Ous, a popular item on the menu that also sound delicious. For dessert that had this chocolate ganache topped with small pieces of bread, like croutons almost, that had olive oil so it was sweet and salty with some crunchiness to it, really good.
The service was as good as I expected it to be and the owner was very attentive as well as the waiter. I can't wait to try the rice with scallops they had last week and definitely the Ous. The joint is very small so I don't recommend large groups, keep it small.",Miami

The food was absolutely stupendous! Absolutely nothing bad to say about a single one of the dishes. This place has one of the best steaks I have ever had at a restaurant. With the current Miami Spice deals it's an absolutely uncontested champion of value for what you get from it.",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Tommy Thang,5,"During our recent stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Miami, we had the opportunity to dine at Toro Toro on a Saturday night, and it was a pleasant experience.

Our evening began in the comfortable lounge area, where we enjoyed a couple of cocktails while watching a college SEC game on a large screen. The combination of sports, bar ambiance, great food, and attentive service made for an enjoyable start.

Our server from the lounge also provided excellent service at our dining table. She was knowledgeable about the menu and even brought the head chef to our table for an introduction and to explain some of the dishes.

We started our dinner with prawns, octopus, and pork belly, which were all satisfying. However, the highlights were the perfectly cooked filet mignon and the flavorful red snapper, along with a great wine list offering many worldwide options. We ordered a bottle of Medalla Malbec from Argentina, which had a very nice bouquet, medium to full body, dark ruby red color, low tannin, and a slightly dry finish.

Our side dishes, including broccolini and lobster mac and cheese (amazing), were also well-prepared and delicious. The dessert options, such as flan, key lime pie, and various cakes, were tempting for those with room for dessert.

The overall dining experience at Toro Toro was fantastic, with our high-top dining table and big screen TV adding to the ambiance, especially with the great service and tasty food. We would definitely consider returning on our next trip to Miami.",Miami

The MASHED POTATOES!? Heaven. I do not like the broccolini/asparagus though, undercooked and rough. Everything else, including Yahsira‚Äôs service, was PHENOMENAL. It‚Äôs worth eating here to try out! Unique good, unique drinks, great experience! Make sure you leave room in your pocket (pricey, but high quality).",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Holmes Beltran,5,"Another amazing dinner date with friends for the first time at this joint. Im going to skip the drinks not because they weren't good but because the food is just amazing here. To start the apps are so delicious and l'Il tell you which ones we liked the most so let me break it down for you....
The lomo saltado empanadas: tender and juicy beef tenderloin with avocado and soy sauce, melted mozzarella. The beef was so flavorful that I almost ordered seconds and everything just melted in my mouth. I guarantee you that when you try these you'd want to place an extra order, that good.
Chicharr√≥n de camarones: crispy shrimp, aji Amarillo, avocado and rocoto mint salsa. This tastes almost like a sweet and sour shrimp but crispy.
Shrimp perfectly cooked and the crust was just amazing.
Chaufa: one of the best chaufa(fried rice) to date.
Rice cooked to perfection with chorizo and chicken and good portion.
Grilled Octopus: I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that this is the best grilled octopus I've ever tasted. Tender to the core while charred on the outside and sitting on an amazing sauce, this is by far the best grilled octopus in town. It comes with a side of potato salad that is good but unnecessary if you ask me because this octopus needs nothing on the side.
Chicken and chorizo croquettes: my wife absolutely enjoyed these croquettes so much she almost didn't share lol.
Cheese board: five different cheeses including goat and mamchego with honey and fig jam.
Skirt steak: medium well cooked perfectly and tender topped with plum, string potatoes and a delicious salsa verde.

Mac and cheese: surprisingly a really delicious Mac and cheese at a Peruvian joint is shocking.
La Bomba dessert: amazing presentation and very yummy. Chocolate sphere with berries, Dulce de Leche and strawberry ice cream, almond cookie crumbs, cheese mouse, vanilla and berry sauce all collapsed on the table over a plastic cover and big enough to share between four people.
Cortadito cheesecake: least favorite and really nothing special.
Having broken down the dishes I have to say that the service was top notch and possibly exceptional compared to other places we've been to. Our waitress was most attentive, friendly, helpful and interactive.
Going for the parrillada type dish for two people next time we come here.",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Megan Roloson,5,"We picked this place to eat just by its name and were not disappointed. The outside seating is amazing by day and magical at night. Service was a tad slow, but given the overall food and experience, I can't complain. That said, I wasn't a fan of the world's best chocolate cake, but when in Rome. There was also someone walking around and taking your photo. Then then offered them to you in a frame for $20. Normally, I am not into  being solicited at dinner, but she was very respectful and low-key about it. The photo looked great, so we ended up buying one. Overall, 9/10 from me, I would not recommend taking kids there, though.",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Melissa Munilla (Meli),5,"I‚Äôve been here before for brunch but finally tried out dinner. Everything was DELICIOUS. I had the Luxury Paradise Martini to drink & every entree comes with a free appetizer. I went with the Ox-Tail Tacos & the Wagyu Steak with truffle mashed potatoes. Dessert was not that memorable for me. Our server, Anastasia, was very friendly, understanding & patient. Totally recommend this place for its service, ambiance & food ü§ç",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Tiff_ Eatz,5,"First time visiting Dolores But You Can Call Me Lolita, not from the area and the whole experience here was elite. The rooftop area is absolutely beautiful, the music, the decor, absolutely perfect. The food is delicious, the menu style has a bit of everything you‚Äôd want for brunch and then some extras that are attractive, like their desserts. The service is top tier! We had a slight issue that cause us to be delayed with our arrival and they were more than accommodating and one other suggestion, is to add non dairy for coffees, they stated only dairy is used. For us coffee lovers. Greatly appreciate that and our waitress, Ana, was great! Very kind and provided great service, thank you for making this visit extra great!",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Aimee Albright,5,"I absolutely LOVE the vibe of this place. It‚Äôs very cute & lush! The food was delicious - I had the Poke Bowl & it was surprisingly big.

ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,GV G,5,"Held a private dinner event here and the service was top notch. And the food!? It was delicious! Their cornbread was sooooo good and some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, delish!

Would totally recommend this restaurant.",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Patty Vazquez,3,"It is no secret people come here for the ambiance. I found the food to be okay. I liked my 2 appetizers a lot, and my corn fried rice just tasted like rice. I had 2 drinks as well - I am used to paying the prices of the drinks, but was somewhat shocked at the size for the price. However, I will say drinks were delicious.",Miami

From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the restaurant's modern and stylish ambiance, which perfectly complemented the ocean-inspired theme. Each dish was a masterpiece, showcasing the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The chef's creativity was on full display, with innovative flavor combinations that tantalized my taste buds. Even the presentation of the dishes was a work of art, almost too beautiful to eat!",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Arlene Rios,5,We went for my daughter‚Äôs 20th birthday! We were in awe of the place from the moment we walked in. The staff was very welcoming and our server Francisco was on point. The food was exceptional! Presentation is everything. From the appetizers to the drinks to the food and even dessert was amazing!! It was a lovely experience.,Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Sidhdesh Halde,5,"Always wanted to dine here, and see what‚Äôs all the hype about. decided to surprise my wife with dinner reservations at 6:00 pm, we got there at 5:45 and were seated right away. We were only given a wine list, and a few minutes later, the familiar stopped and asked us if you want to start with wine or cocktails, after saying, we want to start with cocktails he gave us a different menu and asked our water choices. I got the sparkling water my wife just got a tapwater, and then we were greeted by our server who took our drink orders. We got two appetizers, two drinks and a dinner to share amongst us and a kimchi fried rice. The appetizers were really good and so was the dinner. The manager stopped by a couple times to ask if everything was good with our food and drinks and decided to order another cocktail which was really good. It was a really nice experience and finally got to check out the bathrooms which will make you think that you are under the water. I‚Äôm giving this a five star as a service was top notch and we felt special when we were there. Definitely recommend this place to try something out of the box. The menu prices are on the higher side but I think it was worth it. we also tried their chocolate lava cake and it was the best ones I had in a while.",Miami
ChIJO0ydDCW_QIYRwqhTW2v3G-g,"Joshua Castro, LPC",4,"The Pearl is only open for breakfast, so lunch and dinner come out through bar. I wasn't happy since that wasn't what I was aiming for on a date night, a TV in the background. The food menu is limited but the steak and risotto were both well done. The bartender made the night enjoyable, extremely attentive. We got lucky it was practically empty. On a busy night, I'm sure he wouldn't be able to attend to us as much. Overall if you're looking for a decent place to eat before a night on the town, this is it. If you're looking for upscale date night, this isn't.",Houston

ChIJO0ydDCW_QIYRwqhTW2v3G-g,Michiel Buitelaar,3,"Nice food - though the portions are too big, and prices are pretty high (hence 3 stars not 4). Food good though. Service very OK. Atmosphere so-so, almost empty on Friday night.

Sprouts were great. Fries - without pork, cheese and other over-the-top things - were nice. Fried oysters were OK but could/should have been bit more spicy.",Houston
ChIJO0ydDCW_QIYRwqhTW2v3G-g,Brandi Bagby,1,"Not a good experience at all. The place is nice, clean and the ambience is great but the food did not match the menu at all. The shrimp tacos did not have anything on it that the menu said it would. The chicken sandwich had chicken strips on it with a hot sauce on it but there was no mention of any of that on the menu.",Houston

ChIJ_0MiMm6_QIYRr7XETdEk5ZE,Denise Wilburn,5,"I‚Äôm currently visiting Houston for the next six weeks. Yesterday, I placed a pickup order for us. I received an email confirming the order and soon thereafter, I received a phone call from the restaurant requesting information about my vehicle and confirming the pickup time.
When I arrived at the restaurant, I parked and decided to go inside. The staff greeted me with such a warm welcome and directed me to the counter to retrieve the food. I was instructed to ensure that the order was accurate while the payment was processing. While leaving, the staff genuinely thanked me for visiting.
When I got home and ate, the food was impeccable. The chicken was well seasoned, and the French toast was delectable. The entire entree was plentiful.
Later in the afternoon, an employee from the restaurant called to ensure there were no issues with my order. I thanked the employee. I also wanted to let you guys know how much I appreciate the superior level of service provided throughout my dining experience. I feel like a valued customer and that‚Äôs very important to me when I spend money anywhere. Please continue to DELIVER! Often, the actions of others go unnoticed, but yours didn‚Äôt! I can‚Äôt wait to visit again!",Houston
ChIJ_0MiMm6_QIYRr7XETdEk5ZE,Alonzo Salas Jr,4,"The food was real good. I can‚Äôt complain about the food. Other than the fact that the food got cold faster than normal , the line took about 45 minutes to an hour to get inside and seated. They do charge you and get your order in before you sit down as well, the atmosphere inside is lively but dark meaning it needs a little bit more lights inside.",Houston
ChIJ_0MiMm6_QIYRr7XETdEk5ZE,Nicholas P,5,"If you see a long line, that‚Äôs a good thing it means that it‚Äôs popular. I‚Äôm always kind of skeptical of places that are dead with no one inside. With that said, food is worth it. Service was pretty good. Employees were very nice. I highly recommend getting the wings and waffles and fried katfish. Some of the best fried chicken and waffles I‚Äôve ever had. Prices are reasonable.",Houston
ChIJ_0MiMm6_QIYRr7XETdEk5ZE,jaime garcia,5,"Today I am reviewing the wing and pancake plate

I got it, let‚Äôs try it, and rate it 1-10.

Wings were season well, super crispy and juicy.

Pancakes were soft and melt in your mouth.

I can see my self coming back to try the rest of the menu.

Definitely a lot of food. You Can share this easily. I wasn‚Äôt able to finish the entire meal.

Customer service was good. They gave me a call a head to confirm my order and let me know what time the food would be ready for pick up. It was ready right on time.

Service   9",Houston
ChIJ_0MiMm6_QIYRr7XETdEk5ZE,Aisha Shields,5,"This was an AMAZING experience. We opted for the Signature Cafe. It shortened our wait time and it's in the new 'Alley Cat' lounge. The vibe was cool, the service was EXCEPTIONAL, and the food was a 10/10. The drinks were 9/10. We will definitely be back sooner rather than later.

ChIJx5IjV9W_QIYR8vy3_t2ySsY,Becky S.,1,"This was our first time visiting and I was not impressed with the place. Food was was not what it seemed to be from all the reviews. The bar had a rush from a good group of people, which slowed down our drinks, but after they left. Our drinks still came out slow, which we decided to stop ordering drinks.

Our waiter seemed nervous and intimidated by everything. The food was mediocre and what was recommended was not at all what we expected. We got a few sushi rolls, the Angry Scorpion which was recommended had no flavor and no spice, the other one was so so. The lobster on the ‚Äúlobster mac & cheese‚Äù was rubbery as it was over cooked. We had a few other appetizers, which were okay.  The drinks were good, but since the drinks were coming out slow we stopped order and all I can say is that nothing we had was worth coming back for.",Houston
ChIJx5IjV9W_QIYR8vy3_t2ySsY,Goldie Frost,5,"A memorable lunch experience for all the best reasons: a truly welcoming and feisty energy from the lovely hostess, stellar ambiance, world-class food, friendly kitchen experts, exceptionally charming and professional service from Theo and Veronica, smooth and gracious valet service. While steak is a prominent feature here and tomahawks abound, make no mistake that everyone can find something to enjoy on this eclectic menu: empanadas, salads, salmon, Cuban and other sandwiches, and possibly the best ceviche we have ever eaten. While Scotch and wine were more our game, the length of the tequila list was truly jaw-dropping. We can't wait to return!",Houston
ChIJx5IjV9W_QIYR8vy3_t2ySsY,Lars M√πhlenbruch,5,Nice place to eat. Went there for breakfast there. Had an avocado toast and orange juice. Both really yummy. The servers were super friendly! They are very communicative and seem to like their job. Loved it here.,Houston
ChIJx5IjV9W_QIYR8vy3_t2ySsY,Robert Velarde,5,"Toro Toro Restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel is an absolute gem! With an elegant atmosphere, it's a top pick for family dinners. We were thrilled to go during Houston Restaurant Week, which showcased a well-crafted menu. The cocktails are as tasteful as they are creative. To complement our meal, we opted for a bottle of Duckhorn wine‚Äîexquisite! The staff rounds out the experience with their warmth and welcoming demeanor. This is definitely a place we'll revisit soon. Highly recommended for any occasion!",Houston
ChIJx5IjV9W_QIYR8vy3_t2ySsY,Precise Marques Wilson-Johnson,3,"Selected this restaurant for our 1st Anniversary, and although the ambiance and service was great, the food overall was not what we expected.  Being a steakhouse, we assumed that it would be the highlight of the evening, but it was not. The drinks, service (s/o to Oscar), and apps/sides met our expectations (saving grace).  Thankfully, the hubby enjoyed himself üòÑ, but wish I could have WOW'D  him!",Houston
ChIJwXVOyYW_QIYRwpic8adepKs,Anton S.,5,"I had good experience here - had the lobster roll with fries. Everything as expected. Bread and lobster were very fresh. Fries were very crispy.

ChIJwXVOyYW_QIYRwpic8adepKs,Patrick Corrales,2,"Food took so long to serve and it didn't look like anything like what's on their Instagram (sloppily plated, to be honest) . Giving 2 stars coz it actually tasted good, despite yellowing celery leaves. But maybe eat elsewhere instead.",Houston
ChIJwXVOyYW_QIYRwpic8adepKs,Thomas Hill,1,"Complete foolishness, they give you .01 ounces of fish with the ceviche and charge you $18 dollars. The photo attached below looks much larger than what they give you in real life. Flavor was just okay. Literally nothing special about it nor is it worth the price. I wouldn‚Äôt waste your my money here again because there are far better ways.",Houston
ChIJwXVOyYW_QIYRwpic8adepKs,Ryan Levy,3,"I really wanted to love my dinner experience here, especially after reading the glowing reviews from critics.  But I left feeling let down- as I definitely didn‚Äôt have the experience the critics did.  We had an early midweek dinner reservation and the restaurant was sold out of clams, mussels, lobster, and blue fin tuna.  The seafood we ordered was very very good.  The scallop crudo was spectacular.  The oysters were very fresh and the shrimp was delicious.  However, the $20 Caesar salad was ordered with dressing on the side and came swimming in it.  It just wasn‚Äôt great. No corrective action when it was pointed out.  Things I wish I had known before I went: parking can be a problem- the food court that the restaurant is in can get very very crowded- we had trouble finding a spot in the paid lot.  The food court is very very loud.  Conversation at our table was a challenge.  Expect to pay high end sushi restaurant prices without the ambience or service levels.  The food will be great.  Call ahead to find out what they have run out of before going.",Houston
ChIJwXVOyYW_QIYRwpic8adepKs,Jason Matsumoto,5,"Three of us decided to check this place out for a work dinner. We had heard about it from colleagues and as a former resident of Norway, I thought it would be interesting to experience the fusion of Scandinavian and Gulf Coast seafood and techniques. We were not disappointed, as the food was top notch. We had the salmon sashimi (10/10), the fish and chips (9/10), a half dozen East Coast/half dozen Gulf Coast oysters-on-the-half-shell combo (10/10...incredibly fresh tasting and perfectly shucked and presented), the kanpachi crudo (9/10.....fresh as you can get, skillfully prepared, and the sauce it was served in was incredible on its own), and the steamed mussels (6/10). The mussels were the only average thing we tasted. The service was excellent, but the ambiance wasn't great. It was very brightly lit and while this particular place was almost empty of customers, the surrounding food hall was loud and full of somewhat rowdy patrons. I don't mind that if it's what I'm expecting, but for an expensive work function where you want to enjoy an intimate conversation, it's probably not the best place in town. I will go back, but not for the same type of meeting. All in all, this is an experience that is totally worth it if you like the best of the best in fresh seafood that is skillfully prepared and presented.",Houston
ChIJbSHsPTm_QIYRcvGUmAJbfCE,Qimar Abhiram-Alfasi,3,"Service was excellent. The food is geared towards people who don't like seasoning in their food. I had the Salmon, it was good quality but not tasty to me. The Shula salad was good and the cheesecake was delicious. I'm sorry I just like more flavor in my food.",Houston
ChIJbSHsPTm_QIYRcvGUmAJbfCE,Blake P,4,"The food here is always solid. I have no complaints at all. However, it‚Äôs hard to compete in this market in Houston when we have so many options in the steakhouse game. I have been here 5-7 times and I will say that the blackened salmon and shrimp are my favorite by far. It‚Äôs excellent. This is a perfect option for a weekday work lunch but not something like a date night.",Houston
ChIJbSHsPTm_QIYRcvGUmAJbfCE,YuWanÈ±º‰∏∏,4,Had breakfast here after conference. Not many options but food is of great quality. Ordered omelette and pancakes and both were good! My friends told me that biscuits are must try in US and they are indeed really good!,Houston
ChIJbSHsPTm_QIYRcvGUmAJbfCE,Kayleigh G,5,"Despite the challenges of serving a very large group, the servers were prompt and friendly. The pimento cheese appetizer was good. Many of my friends ordered the Filet & enjoyed their entrees very much. But we generally agreed the French Dip was one of the best we've ever tasted! It was so good, I hope I can visit again if I'm ever in the area!
My only critique is the menu didn't state my meal came with fries otherwise I would've asked if there were any alternatives. But they looked really yummy!",Houston
ChIJbSHsPTm_QIYRcvGUmAJbfCE,John West,5,"The breakfast was outstanding. For $24.95, there was a wide range of breakfast food available, including bacon, scrambled eggs, potatoes, grits, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, coffee, and more.

Both of us felt the meal was lacking something to give it that wow factor. Also, the brussel sprouts were very greasy. My husband had the lamb chops and really enjoyed it. His only complaint was the serving size. The cost for the meal was a little pricey, but our server was very friendly and accommodating. We decided to try this place again. Service was mediocre and the food was just ok.",Houston

.
We arrived as a large gaggle, but the staff was efficient in their service. We asked for a pickleback plus a cocktail, and the cocktails were excellent.
.
The pickle back made us laugh. The bartender doesn't keep pickle juice--fair enough--but reached out to the kitchen for help. She got all they had, which was fantastic. The funny part is that the juice was from ""bread and butter"" pickles! It was a surprising twist, not completely successful from a taste standpoint. The slightly sweet flavor did quench the burn of the whiskey. I won't repeat this at home, but I surely appreciated the attempt!
.
So kudos to the bar. A for effort!",Houston
ChIJf1QRkS-_QIYR7EoVnFv8P0g,Britt D. S.,1,"Both the food and service here is horrible. The food tasted like the cheap food you get at low budget resorts. The  meat was mushy with no flavor and I can tell part of my order was microwaved. Also, the service is non existent. I go to the dinner area, nobody is there. The bar lady is looking at me, but no greeting. I finally go to her and ask if they were open, she states ""yes, but there aren't any waiters but you can sit at the bar."" Once sat, she kept forgetting my order, asking me to repeat myself multiple times. Then, once i finally got my food upstairs,  it was wrong. I had to call management to complain and they rushed to my door with the food. This is despicable for a restaurant that is supposed to be five stars.

We made our reservation through OpenTable, and were told that we had to all be present to be seated, which was no problem. Upon arriving with our reservation and all of us being present to be seated, we still had to wait for a table which was just a little confusing to me. Why make a reservation if we still have to wait? Nonetheless, we were seated, and our server was very prompt and attentive. All of our meals came out very quickly, and were all very delicious. As far as a brunch place, this particular restaurant did not fit the aesthetic that I had in my head for a brunch location however, the brunch that is served is very delicious so if you‚Äôre looking for a really really great brunch menu, then this is absolutely the place but if you‚Äôre looking for a place that‚Äôs more like the aesthetic of brunch then you may want to consider another place.

Rose, the bartender, was so kind and she provided great recommendations.  We decided to try the shrimp and grits with a side bacon.  The shrimp and bacon were delicious but the grits were just okay.

ChIJ3bWsn0C_QIYRnsu8HF3_jZY,Eric Smith,5,Had the steak nachos when I arrived at the hotel and decided to get breakfast the next day.  The ham cheese and egg croissant sandwich was outstanding. So was the coffee.  Price point was fair as well.,Houston
ChIJ3bWsn0C_QIYRnsu8HF3_jZY,Sergio Martinez,5,Stopped in for a quick business trip and was pleased to find the restaurant serves late.  I ordered the blackened snapper and it was tasty and didn't need any extra seasoning.,Houston
ChIJ3bWsn0C_QIYRnsu8HF3_jZY,Maria Romero,5,Stayed at The Whitehall Hotel and on the second floor they have the best little restaurant.  Depending on your room if you get the free complementary breakfast during your stay.  This is not a continental breakfast! It's a huge serving.  I love it here. The food is really good. But for me the service is outstanding.  Highly recommend the restaurant even if you aren't staying here.,Houston
ChIJ3bWsn0C_QIYRnsu8HF3_jZY,Jennifer Miller,5,"The service is really what makes this place, but the food is great too! I've only done it where you order from the bar and they bring it to your table. Not sure if they do anything else, but it looks like they used to. My coworkers and I have stayed twice at the hotel and we have ""our table"" that we use each stay for breakfasts and dinners. The staff is fantastic. So accommodating! And, honestly, the food portions are a bit much for some of the meals. I feel so bad not eating it all.",Houston
ChIJ3bWsn0C_QIYRnsu8HF3_jZY,Sarah Payne,5,Finding it was tricky because it is on the 2nd floor of the Whitehall hotel but the concierge pointed us in the right direction. Service was great. It was quiet but the food was good and hot. The portions were large for us Brits so we didn't manage to finish our two courses so bring your appetite!,Houston
ChIJsT1r2yO_QIYRdz286CS4Kt0,Hillary Contreras,5,It was definitely an experience. The service and food were more than perfection. I kid not when I say as soon as you‚Äôre done with your meal they come and pick the plate up. The servers are extremely kind and very helpful when it came to suggestions. The food and the drinks were unbelievably delicious. The valet were also very attentive and kind. This restaurant is a jewel in the heart of Houston.,Houston
ChIJsT1r2yO_QIYRdz286CS4Kt0,Flor Kelly,5,"It starts as a casual husband nag, stating, I told him to make a reservation üòå We were visiting to celebrate our 11th anniversary. The hostess was great, and she was kind and informed that she could get us an outside table. The food was beautiful and delicious, and the service was impeccable. It was a crowded day, so needless to say... Make reservations. Please don't risk it to be on the safe side. Thank you, Xochi team, for always staying on top of your game and making us feel loved on our special day.",Houston
ChIJsT1r2yO_QIYRdz286CS4Kt0,Donato Cabrera,5,Truly one of the best Mexican restaurants in the United States. It is hard for me to pick a favorite because everything I had there was incredibly good. The service was exemplary and the ambience was ideal. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.,Houston
ChIJsT1r2yO_QIYRdz286CS4Kt0,Liza D‚ÄôArmas,5,"Visited this modern Mexican restaurant in downtown Houston, and it was an incredible experience! The food was absolutely amazing, and the service was top-notch. Carlos, our friendly waitress, took great care of us and provided excellent recommendations on what to order. We'll definitely be back",Houston
ChIJsT1r2yO_QIYRdz286CS4Kt0,BadAss Chick,5,"XOCHI restaurant offers a fantastic dining experience. The food is delicious, and the ambiance is delightful. I particularly enjoyed the cactus decorations on every table, which added a unique touch to the environment. Highly recommend",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Jacob Kaitholil,5,First date after our baby was born and it was definitely worth it. We got to take part in the Chef‚Äôs Counter experience which was a 7 course meal curated to a max group of 6 people. The food was amazing and each dish was presented to us by the chef who made it. The staff was super friendly and made the dining experience a lot of fun.,Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Johnt√° W.,5,"Personally one of my favorite brunch spots in Houston.
Special shoutouts to Wednesday & Andrew for their excellent service.

Things I enjoy eating.

The crab cake hush puppies.
The swordfish.
The deviled eggs.
Shoot. Everything I‚Äôve had so far has been delicious and devoured.

If you are looking for a nice, quiet but lively brunch spot with a lot of visual appeal I would definitely suggest this place.",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Mariana Mercado,5,"Service is wow!!! From the waitress to the servers everyone is so attentive and nice. We started off with a peach salad, a very unique taste so it is a must try! Also the ravioli a very unique taste with corn filled and pepitas, had never had anything like that before. The fried eggplant was delicious!! Not a fan of eggplant but the crisp and sauce gave it an extra twist! I had the pork (since I don‚Äôt eat seafood) and it was very flavorful! My husband had the fish and oysters (the ones from Canada which are more salty where his favorite)! Definitely a must try if you are in Houston! Forgot to mention the dessert! The best dessert I have had in HOUSTON!!!",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Jiah Park,5,"My son liked bolognese pasta. It wasn't salty and the sauce was really deep. It's not in the picture, but the grilled octopus was delicious and the oysters were fresh. Don't miss pecan ice cream for dessert.",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Moon Morales,5,"So this place never disappoints and we‚Äôve been coming over a year and it‚Äôs one of my top 3 restaurants in Houston! My favorite thing is the attention to detail when it comes to the marriage of ingredients to make some of the most amazing tasting dishes. The chef has carefully placed a unique spin to some of the classic home cooked dishes while respecting and honoring the culture and roots of each dish. After having the cheesy grits I said the chef must be from Alabama because that first bite took me back when I ate some cheesy grits in Alabama. The ambiance is classy, southern and cozy and you are always greeted like family and on your way out a delightful ginger Whoopi pie is offered for Free!!! Who does that in Houston???  Manager George is so personable and the entire staff is awesome!!",Houston
ChIJz0RM1_i_QIYRYz_37v7X3iY,Becca Hernandez,5,"Some of the best bartenders EVER. Kept me laughing the whole time. Joe and Kevin were awesome tonight.ü•∞
The food was BEYOND AMAZING as well. ‚ù§",Houston
ChIJz0RM1_i_QIYRYz_37v7X3iY,mohamed Salem,4,"It is a very nice hotel , location and rooms are good but the main issue is the elevator which is slow and only one",Houston
ChIJz0RM1_i_QIYRYz_37v7X3iY,Deborah F. McGlynn,1,Overly expensive and incredibly low quality. Just go somewhere else. I stayed at the Cambria for a conference and just stopped by the Phoenician grocery store three block aways for breakfast. They have prepared food and a cafe that was half the price.,Houston
ChIJz0RM1_i_QIYRYz_37v7X3iY,Sei Wallace,5,"The bar was fun, service was good, and the flat bread pizza hit the spot after a night filled with drinks. Lol",Houston
ChIJz0RM1_i_QIYRYz_37v7X3iY,Gina McCann,5,"Staff was amazing but the bartender, with red hair, was absolutely fabulous and it was great that travelers seated at her bar were all interacting with each other.",Houston

ChIJ1_fBKTG_QIYRWdRY0QE5LH0,Micheal White,5,"After touring the Aquarium with my family, we decided to grab a bite to eat at the Aquarium restaurant. We got an appetizer, a kids meal, and dessert!

The service was amazing and the food we order was pretty good. The dessert was amazing!",Houston
ChIJ1_fBKTG_QIYRWdRY0QE5LH0,Gynnifer,5,"Super clean, the bathrooms were really clean. The staff was super friendly. Our waitress was very helpful and very accommodating. It was a bit pricey but we had fun and enjoyed ourselves.",Houston
ChIJ1_fBKTG_QIYRWdRY0QE5LH0,Gena Smith,5,"Food was good, atmosphere was interesting and very enjoyable, but the highlight of our visit was the service! The hostess was polite and efficient, the manager who returned our Landry's card was polite and professional, and our server Roberto was outstanding! On a very busy, crowded, hot day, he took the time to explain to our girls about the fish in the tanks, delivered our drinks quickly, made sure we got everything we wanted from the kitchen, and just overall took exceptional care of us.",Houston
ChIJ1_fBKTG_QIYRWdRY0QE5LH0,Liza Gultom,4,"My husband brought me here to celebrate my bday,so far I like the place as well my little girl, because she can see the big giant aquarium with a lot of fish in it üòâ.
The food and drink came on time. The only thing is my husband order his food and to tell the waiter to  make it spicy and the waiter ask if it‚Äôs okay to give jalape√±o and we said Yes.the food came we did not see the jalape√±o and ask our waiter and it took a long time to bring it out.
And after we finished the dinner, the waiter also forgot to brought the complimentary cupcake for us. So we have to remind again to bring it. And during to pay the bill they charge us for extra $ for something we did not order.
My suggestion to all Check your bill before you pay.",Houston
ChIJq13iF_TAQIYR93rF2J-02XI,Feifei Le,5,"We decided to try out this restaurant as we love Bartlett‚Äôs from Austin and this restaurant‚Äôs got some ties to it back when it was called Houston‚Äôs. The atmosphere and menus are pretty similar but I‚Äôd say Hillstone has slightly less options. The food was just as to be expected delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. All the food we got was perfect and I only wish we had more. One thing to note is this restaurant has a pretty strict attire and cell phone policy - while my pictures were fine, any phone calls had to be taken at the front.",Houston
ChIJq13iF_TAQIYR93rF2J-02XI,Sanders Tactical Performance,5,"The food and service was absolutely fantastic! The lighting was perfect, the food was amazing, and the aura in the place was very welcoming. Ashlyn was phenomenal and we will definitely ask for her each time we reserve. Thank you Hillstone for the phenomenal hospitality.",Houston
ChIJq13iF_TAQIYR93rF2J-02XI,Caroline Sinclair,5,"I've been eating at Houstons since I was a child and it's always been a lovely experience. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is rustic and comfortable, the service is always excellent, and I've never left without planning my next meal there. A true Houston classic, perfect for any occasion. And they get a perfect black-and-blue sear on the steak every single time!",Houston
ChIJq13iF_TAQIYR93rF2J-02XI,Juan Chavira,4,"This is my second time here, and both times I've had the same dish - Thai Noodle Salad. However, I've also seen the dishes my colleagues order and I will go back to expand my horizons. The service is great, the atmosphere is very pleasant, and the overall experience has been comforting. I am most definitely be going back soon.",Houston
ChIJq13iF_TAQIYR93rF2J-02XI,Sandra Wiles,4,"The food and Atmosphere were great, but the service was Average,  A waiter came to our table to deliver our Appetizers and before we finished asking for plates he dashed off, He seemed irritated he didn't even acknowledge us he just basically threw the plates down.. I can't comprehend how people are so miserable at work, He was wondering the table next to us I would hate to think he was rasists he was extremely friendly and happy with the people he was serving next to us, I will return because I love the food here but felt very uncomfortable because him on a better note our waitress was great..",Houston
ChIJh4_KFyS_QIYRnyC9jmI-2F0,Miggs Salazar,5,"Took the wife and two friends for her birthday and had an amazing experience. Service was very professional and attentive from the moment we got there. Food was delicious and very well presented. We all ordered different and tasted each other's choices and all were equally amazing! The atmosphere was excellent with a nice upscale romantic feel. After dinner we headed to the bar were we had more of ther delicious take on the old fashioned, the Potente Gold!! The bar tenders were very cool and friendly except for the one lady who gave of dirty looks and attitude but even that didn't make a dent on the amazing time we had. We will definitely be back.",Houston
ChIJh4_KFyS_QIYRnyC9jmI-2F0,Nicholas P,4,"Fancy Italian restaurant. There are plenty of free parking nearby. Service was good. Restaurant was very clean and I liked how the menus lit up when you open them. Food was pretty good. Portions were sufficient. It‚Äôs worth checking out once, there are so many other restaurants in Houston.

-charred octopus 5/5
-branzino 5/5
-spaghetti al tartufo nero ‚Öò - it‚Äôs good but they were very frugal with the truffle.
-cafe cioccolato 5/5",Houston
ChIJh4_KFyS_QIYRnyC9jmI-2F0,R C,4,"one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. We arrived early and had cocktails in the bar, exceptionall drinks, and great bar tenders. Got sat at our table wich was a very nice cozy booth. When we were ready, our server Lenin was excellent he went over the menu and pointed out some recommendations. Food was unbelievable!",Houston
ChIJh4_KFyS_QIYRnyC9jmI-2F0,Rubina Syed,5,"Definitely $$$$ but worth it. Dress code is enforced, unless you sit in the bar area. The Cacio de Pepe was delicious. Apparently award winning. The filet mignon and the lamb were tasty and cooked to perfection.",Houston
ChIJh4_KFyS_QIYRnyC9jmI-2F0,Cindy Toms,5,Really nice upmarket restaurant for special occasions. Great service. Waiters are knowledgeable about all their dishes and great recommendations. Nice atmosphere.  All the dishes were delicious and very well presented. A little on the more expensive end but nice for the experience and a treat.,Houston
ChIJB4yV5o3AQIYRkzVm6yJUSCM,Erica Camp,5,"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Houston - we always go here for special occasions and it has never disappointed! The service is impeccable and the atmosphere is so cozy since it‚Äôs in a renovated, little house. Had the big mac oysters tonight and they were incredible!",Houston
ChIJB4yV5o3AQIYRkzVm6yJUSCM,Maggie J,5,"We have been here at least half a dozen times over the past 6 or so months. The food here is always top notch! I love that the menu changes consistently so we never get tired of going. The winner winner chicken dinner and nonno's pasta are permanent fixtures on the menu for a reason. The chicken is simple but so crispy and juicy, I love it so so much. Service here is always great and the ambiance of the dining space is very casual and laid back. Do note that this is not a quiet restaurant. I never struggle to hear my dining companions but if you are dining with someone that is hard of hearing this probably won't be your jam.",Houston
ChIJB4yV5o3AQIYRkzVm6yJUSCM,Jim Gossen,5,Top quality food. I had the Pappardelle Bolognese which was delicious and the Olive Oil Pound Cake as well. I highly recommend both. The next time I go I will try the fried chicken dinner. The service was friendly and efficient. All the food I saw looked delicious and well prepared.,Houston
ChIJB4yV5o3AQIYRkzVm6yJUSCM,Leslie Rob,5,"The food was excellent and so were the drinks. I have to tell you, the service stole the whole damn show. First timers, so I had to go in to ask where to park. There's some parking behind the restaurant and street parking (I think). What really made me love this place was the people.

The friendly and kind people who work at Nobie's make it what it is. We enjoyed each dish and the people who stopped at our table to wish us a great evening.

Vibes: fun, friendly, everyone knows your name (obvs they did not - first time - felt like they knew us tho), great music

We had:
Oysters
Beer battered sweet tots with goat cheese
Nonno's pasta
Charlie & the pasta factory
Olive Oil cake
Cookies and Cream pie
Cocktails: Old-fashioned, side car, the teaches of peaches

Can't wait for the next time!",Houston
ChIJB4yV5o3AQIYRkzVm6yJUSCM,Rebecca Michels,5,First time at Nobie‚Äôs and we were definitely impressed! Our favorite dishes were the Texas Tartare and the Charlie and the Pasta Factory. The ambiance and service was wonderful and we will definitely be back to try more dishes!,Houston
ChIJn05yICO_QIYRwvODrs7hhfo,Deanna Colvin,4,"This restaurant can get packed quickly especially after events happening in the area. Nice modern  atmosphere. I love the chandelier in there. Our waiter was slow but I didn‚Äôt mind too much because I like to enjoy my meal with feeling like I‚Äôm being rushed. The food was good. I had the salmon and really enjoyed it, my friend got the shrimp and grits, the shrimp was wrapped in bacon can‚Äôt go wrong there but the grits weren‚Äôt as creamy as she likes them to be, and my other friend had the lamb chops no complaints there. Everything had a lil kick to it but not too much. The cream br√ªl√©e was really good (one of the best I‚Äôve had) and the bread pudding wasn‚Äôt bad either. I like the portion size not too little and not too much. The menu is fairly priced. I can‚Äôt wait to try them for brunch.",Houston
ChIJn05yICO_QIYRwvODrs7hhfo,Haley VerSteeg,5,"We visited downtown Houston for an extended vacation and will remember Hearsay On The Green as a highlight of the trip. It is hard to find good braised short rib in Michigan where we live, but this meal was delicious! It was perfectly cooked and the cheesy grits & Brussels sprouts were awesome accompaniments. Our server was Aaron and he was kind, attentive, and easy to talk to. The atmosphere was a nice mixture of upscale and cozy.",Houston
ChIJn05yICO_QIYRwvODrs7hhfo,Mrs. Nazarene Bassett,5,"I had lovely experience here. The blackens red fish tacos were absolutely phenomenal. The sauce, with the fish and the crunch of the red onion was amazing. The green salsa was fire . The corn was warm, creamy and salty; the way this style of corn should be. My daughter had their wagyu dog and rosemary fries . The dog was juicy and the rosemary fries were crispy and seasoned well. Hats off to the cooks and our awesome
server. What a nice surprise! I definitely recommend coming here",Houston
ChIJn05yICO_QIYRwvODrs7hhfo,Zuzana Ba,5,"Phenomenal experience. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was perfection. Great menu, great service (thank you, Diego!!), food to die for, all in an upscale modern ambiance. Will definitely be coming back.",Houston
ChIJn05yICO_QIYRwvODrs7hhfo,Miss A,5,"First time here and the food was amazing, managed to get a table without a reservation üëèüèΩ I had the Double pork chop with sweet potatoes and green beans! Soooo good!! üòã Also had a Cr√®me br√∫l√®e for dessert. I wish they had this spot in Austin! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Houston üôåüèæüëåüèΩ",Houston
ChIJVXAWOw24t4kRA_8m9CG-5lc,Rebecca Michels,5,"A Saturday night dinner date at Riel, and let me tell you, this place is a foodie paradise! Every dish was unique and tasted phenomenal. Even the cocktails were wonderful. We got the pirogies and mushroom empanadas to start, which were both fantastic. Then for the entrees my husband had the kimchi carbonara which he LOVED and I had the red snapper with collard green dumplings and I LOVED it! Then we decided to keep it going with dessert of the bees knees and THAT was also delicious! Literally not one dud of a dish, we were full and happy leaving!",Houston
ChIJVXAWOw24t4kRA_8m9CG-5lc,Daniel Friedman,5,"One of my favorite new(er) restaurants in Houston!  As a frequent traveler to Houston, Texas, I was pleasantly surprised by Riel.  The restaurant is outstanding (food, service, atmosphere - all A+).  As a party of 6, we ate family style and tried almost everything on the menu.

Everything we ate was a highlight, but if I had to choose a few standouts, they include the market crudo, caviar tots, gem wedge salad, butter burgers, mushroom empanadas, kimchi carbonara, softshell crab and the pierogies.

The food was all flavorful, the ingredients were fresh, and each item was brought to the table when finished.

Be sure to save room for desert as each one made for a perfect ending.

If you get to this point, just book a reservation.  There is no reason not to try Riel.",Houston
ChIJVXAWOw24t4kRA_8m9CG-5lc,Jainif Marediya,4,"Good restaurant. The service is better than the food. We got the caviar tots, pierogis, mushroom empanadas, butter burgers, and kimchi carbonara. We liked the burgers the most followed by the carbonara. We wouldn‚Äôt get any of the other dishes again. The dessert - bees knees - was pretty good but wish the cake was warm as it would‚Äôve elevated the dish as a whole",Houston
ChIJVXAWOw24t4kRA_8m9CG-5lc,Jenny Nguyen,5,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here. The restaurant itself was very modern and clean. Staff were friendly and very attentive.

My espresso martini was delicious and the right amount of strong. I started with the mushroom empanadas, which surprisingly had a nice kick from the chimichurri. The pastry itself was flaky, crispy‚Ä¶ just buttery goodness. I do wish they incorporated different mushrooms in the filling but it was still yummy. The kimchi carbonara was very good. Pasta was cooked to perfection and I loved that they give you the whole shrimp with head and tail. Made the dish even more flavorful. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and try the happy hour.",Houston
ChIJVXAWOw24t4kRA_8m9CG-5lc,Sean Howell,5,Delicious food. Inventive creations like an Asian twist on carbonara and umami rich pirogies. Our favorite was the shrimp cocktail which came paired with something like a gazpacho.  Despite a long work day our server was attentive and very kind.,Houston
ChIJjQK9a-2_QIYR-WP2-YT3ty4,Aleksandrs P.,2,"I was looking for an upscale lunch spot in Downtown Houston and settled on ‚ÄòMain Kitchen‚Äô for a test-run. With its location in a luxurious hotel, I anticipated a fine dining experience. Unfortunately, the reality fell short of the description; it felt more like canteen-level food and service. In all honesty, one could easily find similar fare in the nearby tunnels without paying a premium.‚Ä®‚Ä®Breaking it down, the seating was problematic.

The first table offered had an uncomfortable blast of AC from above, the next was swinging like a pendulum. Finally seated at the third table, ice water was served without asking, despite it being a cold rainy November day. The ice appeared melted. Opting for sparkling water, it turned out to be from a regular water dispenser, I can get the same water at the office. Offer me Ferrarelle or San Pellegrino, not the tap water.

I was looking forward to have a glass of Telmont champagne listed on their November Wine Menu only to find it unavailable, and the staff seemed unfamiliar with it. Even Moet&Chandon wasn‚Äôt available. Settled for cava, which was a decent choice but certainly a downgrade from a champagne.

As for the food, it raised many questions. The ‚Äòexquisite dishes‚Äô and ‚Äòinnovative and delicious menu‚Äô promised on their website were nowhere to be found. The presentation and quality of the dishes felt basic and didn‚Äôt align with the fine dining experience I had anticipated. ‚Ä®‚Ä®For instance, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts were drowned in an excessive amount of Ponzu sauce, not exactly a healthy balance. TX Cut lacked the finesse one would expect‚Äîit resembled a canteen meal with a sloppy presentation and veered more towards Medium Well rather than the ordered Medium. At that point I was already so annoyed, agitated and hungry, so I had no desire to give any feedback anymore.

The food was edible but far from remarkable. It wasn‚Äôt WOW. There‚Äôs ample room for improvement in both food quality and service. Our overall experience was disappointing.

November 10th, 2023",Houston
ChIJjQK9a-2_QIYR-WP2-YT3ty4,Rino Nicholas,5,A nice experience in downtown Houston I was seated immediately and was attended to by the server equally fast the. The burger and side salad was absolutely marvelous. Love the espresso martini as well. Highly recommend this place for great food and overall experience.,Houston
ChIJjQK9a-2_QIYR-WP2-YT3ty4,R C,4,Very nice for a hotel restaurant. Good was on point.  Wings were so juicy on the inside and the dry rub was awesome and crispy on the outside. Empanadas were so flavorful. Pork belly was mouth watering. The burger was good too.,Houston
ChIJjQK9a-2_QIYR-WP2-YT3ty4,La Fleur,5,It‚Äôs a hotel restaurant accessible to outside customers. Nice chill vibes and the food is actually really good for a hotel restaurant and our server Heather was great. Will definitely be back.,Houston
ChIJjQK9a-2_QIYR-WP2-YT3ty4,LeWayne Ballard,5,"Came here for a quick order while staying at the JW Marriott for business.  The bar was full, so grabbed a small table and placed my order to go.  Ordered an arugula greens salad with a grilled chicken breast.  Order came out in 10 minutes and was neatly packed in to go boxes.  Put it together in the room and it tasted great.  Chicken breast was freshly grilled and was very juicy.  The salad was a nice mix of different greens.  Good place to come for a quick bite and the bar looked like a nice place to have some food and drinks.",Houston
