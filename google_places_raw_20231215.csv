ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,S&R,5,"I went to this restaurant to see my best friend who flew in from California. Wanted a special evening to spend time with her and celebrate milestones while enjoying good food and drinks.

We did not have a reservation but were seated promptly after arriving in the main dining room. Michael and Kumar were our server. The entire staff was kind and helpful. My friend and I both got the prix fixed seasonal menu where I opted for the morning glory cocktail and she, the wine pairing.

Food was served at a comfortable and fluid pace. In total, my friend and I tried 10 dishes. The wines paired with the menu was perfect and explanations were thorough.

Food was delicious!

By the end of the evening, we were given apple crumble bread as to go goodies. The bread, even after two days, was still flavorful, moist and delicious.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,JunQi Zhai,5,"Came here for a birthday dinner and had an amazing experience! Upon entry, the staff were extremely kind and the decor was warm and inviting, decorated to mimic the fall foliage. They had an extensive wine and drinks list, but we opted for cocktails instead. The bar was able to make me a White Negroni that was spot on. The 6-course menu was simple but delicious, and everything was well prepared (a few minor plating issues but easily overlooked). My favorite was the duck; the most tender I’ve had this year and the skin was thin and crispy. We ended the night with the birthday dessert and espressos. Overall great experience, and would certainly come back in a different season to see how the restaurant decor and menu changes. Highly recommend.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Brooke Pascarella,4,"We came in for our anniversary celebration and did the seasonal tasting menu + wine pairing. The food is, of course, exceptionally good but not the innovative plates I was expecting at this price point. For almost every course, the wine was poured a bit too early from when the food arrived which felt disjointed. Finally, the decor didn’t suit my taste at all, the fall rustic style felt a bit dated for nyc. Overall great dining experience at a Michelin star, New York establishment. Good to check off your list at the very least.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Greg Welsh,4,"Overall very nice and memorable experience in the dining room. Arrived a little early and table wasn't ready until 15 minutes past reservation time. The tavern was very crowded, so that wasn't a great start. Graciously offered complimentary glass of sparkling wine when we were seated. We added the wine pairing to dinner. Have to say the first couple of courses were very slow to come out. First dish arrived 45 minutes after being seated. Then it was like 30 minutes for next couple of courses. But our glasses were refreshed when the food arrived. All of the dishes were delicious and unique. The squid ink pasta was our favorite. My partner and I should have ordered differently from each other to try more things. Specifically I wish I tried the Norwich Meadows Squash. I preferred the lamb over the duck, but my partner was the opposite. I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order! Our server and sommelier were delightful. I fault no one for the slow speed. I think they were just exceptionally busy for the holidays and the tavern being packed.",New York
ChIJvSQIgqFZwokRFYQbJdzceSs,Eduardo Gonzalez,5,Went for Thanksgiving dinner as is one of the best rated american cuisine restaurants currently. The menu was very well curated for Thanksgiving and I was completely surprised on the taste the manage to accomplish for the Turkey dish they were offering. The rest of the dishes were very good but no surprises there for a restaurant of this quality. A bit overpriced in my opinion,New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Rodman Rodriguez,5,A truly exceptional meal—perhaps the first true two-star Michelin experience we’ve had in Manhattan (surpassing other 3* in NYC earned through celebrity and not substance). All around an absolute pleasure for all the senses.There were several twists that worked very well like bringing the bread after the third course. Another was the diversity of the servers presenting the dishes while still maintaining our head server’s role prominently—it felt very appropriate in a city like NYC. This paired well with the flawless composition and execution of the dishes and the serene yet sensory rich atmosphere. Two stars fully earned!!!,New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Brian W Piper,5,"Hands down, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I waited tables all through college and the service here was next level. They didn't miss a thing.
And the food...just magnificent. We did the chef's tasting menu and the wine pairing and it was expensive, but well worth it.
Not sure that we'll be making a return trip because of the price but it was something that everyone should splurge on at least once.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Sho Yama,4,"I like to enjoy a meal while viewing museums garden.

Meals are perfect if I don't have any allergies.
Gluten-free bread is fried bread and has a lot of oil.
It use avocado as a substitute for shrimp.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Jerron St. Armand,5,"The Modern is a great dining experience and a fantastic way to break up the day when visiting MOMA.  I went for lunch in the dining room and had the 4 course menu.  It included the 4 courses plus the bread.  Each course was delicious in its own way, but the famous eggs on eggs on eggs really stood out.  The extra brioche is a nice tough too cause you'll certainly want more.

They have an extensive wine and cocktail list, and I was very happy with the affordability of the whole experience given how they have 2 stars.  Service was attentive and never felt rushed.  I was dining solo, so the extra little chit chat with me from the staff is always welcome (but never expected).

My only disappointment was when leaving, I didn't want to subtract a star from this since it was outside the dining experience, but I wasn't let back into the museum.  I called a few days earlier and asked if I could reenter from the restaurant and they said yes as long as you show your ticket. I had my ticket out but was told I need to go outside and reenter through the main entrance.  Well unfortunately it was pouring and the line was quite long.  Just be aware that if you're dining you probably won't be let back into the museum.",New York
ChIJMW-gxPtYwokRzDlnsRgq9rA,Tabber B. Benedict,5,"We were treated like royalty and had the wonderful tasting menu.  What a wonderful night! Thank you to the chef, servers,  hosts and all others who made it a night to remember.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Raynor Blom,2,"Review from a Feb 2023 visit. Massive variance between the price point and our experience for the evening. I've heard amazing things about this restaurant over the years but it would appear the changing of the guard after the pandemic has caused a noticeably dip in quality.

The service was objectively great, very attentive to detail and friendly/informed, no issues with adjusting meals for the vegetarian in our group. The interior felt and looked cramped in certain areas as the evening got busier. And lastly for the first half of our visit there was staff and maintenance working on fixing the AC, we were very cold while waiting for our first dishes and greeted with occasional burning/dirty smells while they were working on a fix.

The meal itself was good, nothing revelatory in terms of new flavors or ideas, just quality ingredients made well. For a few specific weak points - the truffle pasta special was just not worth anywhere close to the price, and the root veg on the roast special were under seasoned. Chocolate tart for dessert was excellent.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Tisha Mathlin,5,"Outstanding experience! I give them my outmost recommendation.
First, we had a special occasion to celebrate and we highlighted this in our reservation.
The receptionist carefully reviewed the reservation notes and seated us accordingly. Joseph was a gem and set the tone for the evening.
This definitely elevated the experience from the first moment.
The service delivered by the waiters were perfect. I mean it perfect!
The food was delicious and the drinks was refreshing.
To conclude, would definitely love to come again And I definitely recommend it.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Olivia Leigh,4,"Great atmosphere. An upscale new American restaurant with fresh ingredients. We had the duck which is really good and fresh and a large portion and then we had the steak which did come out undercooked quite a bit and then honestly I didn’t love that they just threw it back on the grill and it came out all different sorts of cooked throughout. The french fries were very expensive and very cold, so that was a bummer if I had noticed before I probably would’ve sent them back. Good meal I’d probably come back, but the prices are high for what you’re getting.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Craig Smith Insurance- Specializing in Medicare,5,"My wife and I celebrated our 22 year anniversary at Gotham. We have been here several times. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming. The food and drinks are on point. If you are looking to celebrate a special event or just want exceptional food, drinks and service then Gotham is the place.",New York
ChIJZ72FzplZwokRmcA7CQzDMj0,Lars G,4,Enjoyed the setting and the extremely attentive and friendly staff. Professional Service at its best. We had the Tuna Tartar and then a varirty of mains. Food was good - but the Lobster stuck out - delicous ! Some nice wines on the menu - a bit too pricy calculated I think !,New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,E Benjamin,5,"On our anniversary, we decided to celebrate at the restaurant of our choice. As soon as we arrived, the staff warmly greeted us, ensuring that our special day would be nothing short of exceptional. The portion sizes may have been modest, but the quality of the food surpassed our expectations, leaving us completely satisfied. Not only was the cuisine delicious, but the ambiance of the restaurant was truly enchanting, boasting a beautiful setting that captivated our senses. The staff's meticulous attention to detail further enhanced our experience, making us feel like cherished guests throughout the evening. Without a doubt, our time spent at the restaurant was absolutely delightful.",New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Albert Law,5,I really enjoy the food and drink from Le Coucou.  They have the best young chicken I ever had in my life.  The lobster salad is great.  The wine is also a good choice.  Thank you for giving me a wonderful time for my birthday,New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Patrick Hewson,5,Everything was fantastic. The tuna starter and the beef main course were particular standouts and will live long in the memory. The wine recommended paired perfectly with the food we chose. Simply put one of the best meals I've eaten this year,New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Vincent Li,1,"I didn’t have high expectations upon arrival and basically ordered what the waiter recommended. By the way, one of the waiters who served us was lukewarm and almost rude. He made his recommendations in a tone that felt more like educating, often using imperative verbs like ‘remember’ to start his sentences, which isn’t the level of service I expected in this kind of environment.

The food was still disappointing. The starters were overwhelmingly sour, with no other flavors to balance them out. The second courses were just average, which matched my expectations. I did like the maitake mushroom that came with the veal sweetbread.

For the main course, we ordered the duck for two. It came with the duck’s breast, leg, liver, and heart, accompanied by fig and mushroom, all covered in reduced duck juice. In a nutshell, it was awful. The juice was very meaty and poorly seasoned, so all you could taste was the meatiness from the duck and the tannin and astringency from the red wine. Also, the breast was dry and meaty. To my surprise, for some part of the duck breast, I couldn’t chew it and had to spit it out.  The foie gras was not too bad but its quality was impaired when covered by that meaty duck juice. We couldn’t have that so took it back home. The heart was also too dry and stiff. Then we found if you flip the duck leg over and look at the other side, it was disturbingly unplucked. Ugh.

I only came to realize this restaurant was Michelin-rated when I wanted to leave a review here because my partner had booked it for a casual dinner. This realization made me more disappointed with the quality and experience.

I do not recommend it. Try Aska or meadowsweet if you are into real good food and service.",New York
ChIJyw5j84lZwokRnUI_UknPSNA,Wei Lin,1,"I recently dined at this Michelin one-star restaurant, and I must say, it left me underwhelmed. I can only give it one star here on Google also ⭐️ because the overall experience was far from what I expected. The food lacked the excitement and creativity I associate with Michelin-starred establishments, resembling something you might find at a standard bistro in Paris. Additionally, the service, while not terrible, was just average. I would recommend exploring other dining options to make the most of your time and money.",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,James L,5,"Came here for dinner. I like the decorations and lighting. I ordered the Hiramasa tartare, and the famous chicken under a brick (in half size, for myself). I like the flavor for both dishes and my taste bud was activated joyfully. Will come back for more dishes.",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Andreas Apostolopoulos,5,"Romantic, cozy, and dimly lit Michelin starred restaurant in Tribeca that fires on all cylinders! From the ambiance to the suave service, from the starters to the dessert, everything was top notch! With a small seasonal menu, the chef doesn't fail to disappoint on any item. The ravioli were tasting many quality, savoring every bite. The duck with cherry sauce was among the best duck dishes we've had, and the chicken under a brick was 120% something to write home about. Absolutely elegant in its simplicity! I love to cook at home and it got me thinking how I could recreate something this amazing with beautiful ingredients! The ""egg"" dessert is a surprise, but it's like something out of a Netflix cooking show, spectacle and flavor in every bite!! Don't hesitate to splurge on an evening here!!",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Alycia Sofia,5,"Had a great experience here. The chicken under a brick was phenomenal. Definitely a sharing plate between 2-3 people, perhaps even 4 if you're light eaters. We started with the bread and butter. It was great. Loved the onion butter. The chicken under a brick was exceptionally excellent. Highly recommend. And we finished it off with the cookie and melted ice cream desert. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. Also best if shared between 2-4 people.",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Kevin Hirchert,5,"One of the best meals I've ever had in my life, absolutely incredible staff.  The GM Andrea was an absolute delight and a pleasure to visit with.  Our server Robert was incredibly outgoing, knowledgeable helpful, and hilarious.  The chef, Connor and his sous chef Xavier gave me one of the best culinary experiences of my life and were a pleasure to chat with as well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone in my life and will definitely be back.",New York
ChIJhSLc_R5awokReYEI4dyODxA,Amir Shevat,5,"Wonderful food, good service. The place had a good vibe despite a few loud banking bros. The starters were phenomenal. Must try the Hiramasa.",New York
ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,Olivia Leigh,3,Nice restaurant overall. Prices are wayyy too high. The steak we had from the steak and eggs for brunch was minuscule but was good (very tough). Burrata was good only 2 pieces of bread for $22. Pizza was actually a generous size and pretty good more of a California style with a large crust. Also side is $4.50 no refills (I know that’s typical for this area but would be nice to see on the menu). Overall fine experience l.,New York
ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,Jacob Berezin,5,"Really nice spot with thoughtful ambiance.
Staff were very nice and helpful.
Drinks were tasty and food was prompt.
My favorite dish was the melt in mouth short rib.
Everything tasted fresh and filling
We went with a few friends would definitely go again.",New York
ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,Kunal Puranik,4,"We had a really good experience dining here. We made reservations so didn’t have to wait, the place was packed on a Friday night. The staff is very friendly, and the service was quick. The food was really good, the bread they serve is outstanding, for mains we tried the cauliflower, and pizzas and liked everything. The dessert however was just okay, it wasn’t bad but didn’t deliver to the high standards the food had set. We’ll definitely be back",New York
ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,michael shanker,2,"Nice place,Great Service. Food ok but over priced. Duck wings crispy but dry and little meat .  Short Ribs were very good rub/ flavor but way to much for 2 people. 4 people this could serve. Celery ribbons should have been peeled .Strange combination of celery ribbons green olives and walnuts Components as a topping",New York
ChIJWVD7FadZwokRs_pS6XY7VOU,Maansi Gupta,3,"The service and atmosphere were both incredible! The waiters were very sweet and attentive. Unfortunately, the food didn’t impress. It felt like the food was trying too much but missed the mark, resulting in a dining experience that was neither wholly satisfying nor novel. I felt full after finishing my meal, but it didn’t wow me. It wasn’t a meal worth remembering.

Green Zebra Pizza: Okay
Salmon: Overcooked
Artichokes: Good
Banana Cream Pie: Good

The “Good” dishes in this meal was the side and the dessert. Again, the service was wonderful, and this with the ambience made the dinner quite pleasant overall. But, given how many options there are in NYC, I wouldn’t come here again.",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Lisa Paradise,5,"Food was very good, service was better
We had the most lovely waiter who made sure to give us honest suggestions on our order so that we had a great variety.
The food was all fantastic - our main note was that all the protein was plated under a cream or sauce or toppings, and each plate we said “wait what’s this one again” 😂 wish we could have seen our food.
Cocktails were 10/10, I think we tried everyone on the menu, no matter what elixir we chose, the drink was A1.
So glad I got to come back to this icon after years; it hasn’t missed a step.",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Juan J. Moreno,4,"After tasting several dishes, all of them surprised me. They were not of my personal preference, but clearly were well designed and executed.  The wine list is impressive. Great service.

The restaurant is small and gets crowded, reservation is not mandatory but highly recommended.

Prices are expensive, as in any other high quality restaurant (and this one has a Michelin ⭐).",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,James,5,"Absolutely incredible meal. Don’t hesitate to make a reservation. Every single dish was delicious and showcased the high-quality ingredients without strong sauces or complicated flavors.

The ambiance itself is lacking. While the space is beautiful, seating is crowded, even for NYC standards. The restaurant gets busy, so expect to be shoulder-to-shoulder with other diners.

That said, the food more than makes up for it, and I do highly recommend priotizing this restaurant over the many other options in the city.",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Eias Murad,4,"Stumbled on Estele while browsing 2022 World’s best 100 restaurants and the Michelin guide. Definitely worth it and didn’t disappoint. Vibe is casual, relaxed and hip with a small bistro feeling. Place is small and buzzing. Cuisine is new American with European influences I will say. I tried few dishes and there were all tasty and full of flavors. Highlight of the menu, Endive with walnuts and Fried arroz negro with squid and romesco. Cooking and execution was on point. You can hang out by the bar or grab a table with a date or group of friends. Good spot for lunch and dinner. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have some good crafty cocktails.",New York
ChIJf3f-f4VZwokRcBCEciTOGRQ,Lucy,5,Just the best! Truly one of my top favorites in NYC. Never disappoints year after year. Perfectly curated menu where absolutely everything looks good. Hard to make a decision! Most recently came for my wedding anniversary. Special spot for things like that without feeling overly pretentious. We also had a fantastic waitress who was lovely and very helpful. Don’t skip the endive salad.,New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Tom Hofer,5,"Amazing steaks and side dishes, the Brussels sprouts were a bit too spicy but the rest was amazing and exactly the way you would want. Great details with the Leona in a glass and very friendly service. At the entrance greeted friendly and recognized the country I am from which caught me by surprise. Great experience and have a glass of the Malbec",New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Kalia Anderson,5,"Traveled to NY for my birthday and I loved this place. I went late in the evening, was seated right away. The staff was so attentive and took great care of me. The host recommended the scallops with bacon, it was so delicious! Order this, you will NOT regret it. I ordered the hand cut fries, and these were some of the best fries I ever had.  I also had the short rib, with polenta and spinach. This dish was also very delicious, they give you a huge helping that I could not finish. The staff sung happy birthday to me, making my night very special. I can't wait to come back to visit.",New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Matthew Coqueran,5,"Took the company out for lunch today.  Got 2 orders of fried oysters, crab cake, grilled octopus, shrimp risotto, grilled salmon over spinach, steak frites, sides of mash, creamed spinach, grilled mushrooms & mac n cheese (yummy yum yum).  We got here at Noon because we wanted to beat the lunch crowds.  Food tasted fresh.... My faves were the Mac n cheese, crab cake and the creamed spinach... The cheese in there was so rich and delicious.  The wait staff was very helpful and attentive.  First class service and with the price.  We'll definitely be coming back here.  Enjoy!!!",New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Kevin Lubinsky,5,"A hidden gem in Midtown. Honestly just spotted it while walking and decided to give it a try. So many places to get steak in NYC, and we hit the jackpot here. Had a Seafood Chateau for starters. Great sampling of oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar, etc. The Tomahawk was perfect. And as big as my head. You have to have the DK potatoes. Trust me. Just order them. I have to say I am surprised that it isn't busy here at all. Shame. Lots of people missing out. Got a reservation just before I got there, but not sure if it is needed all the time. Hopefully business is booming at other times.

The staff were all awesome. Everyone was responsive and engaged and extremely friendly. Kudos to everyone for the great work.",New York
ChIJ7cFMaqxZwokRiwwuIFN8pbA,Jennifer Meraglia,1,Came here on a date and the food was absolutely awful. Had to ask the server for a drink menu twice Felt like we were being judged and thrown in the back of the restaurant when it was completely empty. The pasta I got looked and tasted like dog food. The servers came up to us every 2 minutes asking if we were ready to order. Like let me relax. Now I understand why the lace was empty,New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Sitatham Puechkamut,5,"Capesante was my favorite dish; it was refreshing and well-balanced. Bombalani was uniquely delicious, sugar-coated donuts with pomegranate and chocolate sauce. The risotto was too salty and plain. Beautiful interior design with top service.",New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Denby Liu,4,"Went here for a birthday meal as Marea had been a place I'd heard about and kept meaning to visit.

Specializing in seafood we went heavy on the fishy side of things. Certainly the seafood we had for the first 2 courses were great tasting and had nothing to fault them on. The duck main dish we had was also lovely.

I was disappointed somewhat with the desserts though. I was hoping for similar quality as Lincoln Ristorante as I'd read that the head chef had moved over from that restaurant and always loved their desserts. Sadly, the tiramisu was a strange frozen concoction, not really sure what the pastry chef was trying to achieve there. The bomboloni (AKA donuts) was better and I probably would have been happy if I hadn't had a much better iteration at Casa Limone (and a better selection of other yummy desserts). Have it at that restaurant and you'll understand why the Marea version underwhelmed.

It was pretty heaving with people when we got there and the bar right next to the entrance certainly increased the hub bub. Which put me off as I prefer quieter restaurants, but unfortunately that wasn't to be as there were a lot of people there discussing business. Should have rung my alarm bells as one of the recommendations I had was from a sales person at work.

The decor is nice, but the tables felt cramped together for such a high end restaurant, the crowded bar didn't help with that feeling and that meant you could overhear a lot of conversations, especially the business meals. Don't know if it's always like that but it was definitely a turn off.

The other problem I had was that the dishes were just way over priced. The total bill was heading towards tasting course territory. And that was only with a few drinks, 2 of which were non-alcoholic. I suspect that was a consequence of it being a business meeting hangout and lots of expense accounts...

The ambiance killed the experience for me, loved most of the food, but once was quite enough for me!",New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Javier Kohen,5,All the food was amazing and the staff was very friendly. The flavors and the textures of every dish are composed masterfully. The dining room is airy and bright.,New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Mariya R,5,"Marea is a great place for a special occasion. The atmosphere is amazing, the staff is very polite and friendly. They always want to accommodate. The food is delicious. It’s usually very busy.",New York
ChIJvWSDS_ZYwokRiG9D395loxo,Bredgy L.,4,"Overall the food here is good, but not amazing, especially for the price and the michelin star.

Pólipo - one octopus tentacle cooked beautifully, soft and tender while having that slight snap, and came with a balsamic vinegar reduction and tonnato sauce, providing a balance of sweet, umami and sour. Also had some sort of bitter green, sweet red onions, and roasted potatoes for completeness.

Fusilli - a tubular and relatively firm pasta, with a well balanced tomato sauce that pairs nicely with the beautifully cooked and tender octopus inside, with some breadcrumbs on the top as well.

Spigola - Seared sea bass with a green lemon based puree along with some green beans and a fried celery stuffed with a sort of cheese inside.

Check out @bredgyeats for food pictures!",New York
ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Juancy Rodríguez,4,"Excellent menu that changes seasonally, great tasting Austrian fare with a twist. We were there for an 8pm reservation for 3 on a Thursday evening. The place was bustling, so it took about 10+ minutes to get seated. The service staff was wonderful and even the chef was clearing out tables. The ambiance was great; A couple of blocks down from the 9/11 memorial and the Oculus, Schilling is housed in what seems like a carriage house of 1920s NYC, with interesting industrial touches and curious decor. There's outdoor enclosed plus sidewalk tables plus the street wall is actually a large glass garage door that was closed for the cold. Looking forward to returning when in FiDi.",New York
ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Gui M.,4,"This is a fun little place in FiDi, a place not know for good restaurants. But this definitely is! I loved the tables with the lights coming from metal handles attached to the walls and the overall decor of the place. The food was delicious, especially the pork schnitzel, so thin and juicy and fried to perfection. Would definitely recommend.",New York
ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Abdullah,5,Fun spot in FiDi with very good vibes. I showed up at 6 on a Thursday and was seated immediately. Our hostess (was also working the bar) was extremely nice and was very helpful with the menu. I had the pork schnitzel and it was good.

ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Kristen (Gypsy Monkey),5,"Restaurant week brought me in and I’m so incredibly thrilled to have found this spot ! Love the banquet style table set up . The burger was out of this world and cooked perfectly . Also had some of the best service I’ve had in ages . The waiter was fantastic and his back up helper was also very friendly and attentive . You feel like you are in an old country farmhouse . Except it’s clean ; ) I’d make a reservation because even during lunch it’s busy , once you go you’ll understand why !",New York
ChIJZXs66hBawokRizEXnDJplPw,Sergey Butenco,3,"I visited this resturant with a friend of mine who is a huge fan of Austurian cuisine. We came here to try both schnitzel and apple strudel. Additionally, we ordered trout rilettes after getting a recommendation from our waitress.

Unfortunately, this food was below my expectations. First, the trout rilettes were so salty that we could not finish. The schnitzel was not crispy enough. The only thing we liked was the desert.

However, the ambiance is pretty good. You can have a nice time with your friends. Another note for the resturant is that they should find a solution for the outside door. It keeps banging and is quite annoying for the people having food inside.",New York
ChIJQ1R3hKNZwokRQM4wbIrc00o,Chris Payne,5,"What an incredible find! We ate here on our last night in NYC and it was perfect.

It’s difficult to get a booking here,  especially if you’re just two people so we could only get the outside cabanas booking weeks before. I thought the cabanas would be cold but it was actually perfect, warm and really romantic.

We got the butchers feast and the food was out of this world. We were served by a nice lady from Sweden who took her time to explain the dishes and make recommendations.

An absolutely perfect experience from start to finish.",New York
ChIJQ1R3hKNZwokRQM4wbIrc00o,Richard Yu,5,"Best Korean bbq restaurant ever. By far. Service was impeccable. Dry-aged beef was beyond delicious. Vibe was eloquent and vibrant.

Of course this dining experience comes at a steep price. But Cote is unlike many gimmicky Michelin star rated modern Korean restaurant. Totally worth it and highly recommend for special occasions.",New York
ChIJQ1R3hKNZwokRQM4wbIrc00o,Kelly Zhong,5,"Celebrated my boyfriend’s birthday here and it was such a great experience! The staff was also very welcoming!

The korean bacon is definitely a must-try on their menu, super flavorful and paired with jalapeños and a side of special sauce.

We also got the butcher’s feast for two it came with four cuts of meat plus a bunch of sides which was so filling.

We loved the COTE experience and can’t wait to come back to try other dishes!",New York
ChIJQ1R3hKNZwokRQM4wbIrc00o,Diego Peguero,5,"Delightful evening. Fresh produce, fresh flavors, everything up to standard. Staff is amazing, cocktails are OUT of this world. Would recommend for an special evening with your loved ones. The service doesn't feel rushed either so take your time and eat peacefully. Some booths dont have back-rest and that come with the possibility of gazing your back with another guest which is extremely unpleasant. I would change that. Kudos to the chef, great experience",New York
ChIJQ1R3hKNZwokRQM4wbIrc00o,Chloe,5,"Cote was on my bucket list for a long time. And fortunately, I was able to make a last-minute reservation on a special day. Everything was immaculate. Food was outstanding and service was even better! I loved that the side dishes got complimentary refills. I am usually not a fan of super fancy restaurants because they tend to not focus on making the food great. Instead, they focus on a “fancy” experience and then slap a hefty price tag on mediocre food. But not Cote! This place absolutely deserves its Michelin star!",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Jessica L. Rollén,5,"The food was good and the staff was superb. The dining room is also beautiful. We went for a weekday lunch and it was very much a business crowd. The vibe is borderline stuffy, but the staff was so kind that their warmth offset that.",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Dae M,5,Michael's is the perfect fine dining experience. I came here for my mother's 40th birthday and I really want to thank the staff for making it memorable. A complimentary birthday cake was given to us and the staff sang her happy birthday. The setting is luxurious and the wait staff have everything down to absolute perfection. The margarita pie was warm and cheesy and the fish was well seasoned and presented. I want to thank the manager Basdeo for making our night so special.,New York

ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Rainer,2,"No. For the true New Yorkers, this place is a No. From the sidewalk the space looks nice but as soon as you get seated and settle in you realize it's very stale. If you sit along the east wall you will easily notice the dirty air vents close to the top of the ceiling followed by a not so pretty ceiling. The room is dated, the Christmas garland along the ceiling looked sad, like it's been the same weak rope garland used since 2008 or something. Everyone wrote the service is amazing but I didn't get that at all. It was just myself and my wife. After they took our order, for a good 7 or so minutes we just sat there with water and finally noticed others had bread. We had been sitting for a while with just drinks and no one offered us bread. We had to ask for bread from another waiter and it still took a few long minutes to finally get bread. The crab cake was the size of a small burger patty and the pomegranate salad had huge leaves that were awkward to cut and eat. The raviolis were weak and not creamy, more oily. The bowl for the brussel sprouts was too small for the foods and wasn't the easiest to eat out of bc we didn't want to tip it over. I don't understand all the positive reviews on the food and service. The service seemed less engaged and mostly robotic. The food seemed  basic compared to the prices. They'd forget to bring back another drink so my wife was stuck with water for most of the meal until we reminded them. We vibe was just off. Honestly it mostly tourists around the room. We didn't need to try the dessert. This was a miss for us. Again the room is just stale. Not cute, not styled, no one cares enough type of feeling. I don't write reviews but this one just had to be done",New York
ChIJR-58MPpYwokR6uvm2VX0MK4,Pd,5,"I had the perfect dinner here for Valentine’s Day! Great food, atmosphere and staff all around. Appetizers to dessert was all delicious. I am not even a fan of Kale but even their Kale Caesar Salad was so tasty; I finished it.
I definitely recommend this place.",New York
ChIJR9So-lRYwokRX1xEjA0rChA,Joa J,5,"It was around noon, the restaurant was very busy on top of the Christmas season and a big crowd waiting. My daughter and I wanted to have lunch, and the host accommodated us on the second floor. We didn't have any reservations, so we were super happy to get a table. All the staff was very attentive and polite. We ordered a seafood pasta dish that was incredible! The plates are delicious and big. Two or three people can eat with one order. We definitely recommend this place and do yourself a favor and make a reservation in advance to enjoy your meal here!",New York
ChIJR9So-lRYwokRX1xEjA0rChA,Laire Avila,5,"This is a family style restaurant. Make sure to not go alone. Grab your family or group of friends and go. Plates are big and shareable. Food is amazing. We had the penne a la vodka and it was delicious and as appetizer the fried zucchini, it was excellent. Make sure to make reservations ahead. It gets busy.",New York
ChIJR9So-lRYwokRX1xEjA0rChA,Akeem Akeem,5,"Step into the bustling world of this New York gem! The restaurant was buzzing with life, a lively dance of guests in and out, yet the staff embraced us with warmth and speedy service, even with our fashionably late entrance. Now, let's talk about the real star – the food! Brace yourself for an adventure of flavors, as this place crafts culinary wonders that'll make your taste buds do a happy dance. And oh, the drinks? Absolute perfection!

For the dynamic duos out there, a friendly heads-up: the portion sizes are epic! Consider ordering for one and revel in a shared feast or gather your squad for a gastronomic journey. The ambiance inside is like a warm, cozy hug, but if you dare to brave the chilly outdoors, fear not – they've got mini warmth wizards (aka lamps) at every table. Trust me, the freeze is worth the flavor explosion!

In a nutshell, this spot is not just a restaurant; it's a joyous celebration of food, friends, and fantastic vibes. Your taste buds will thank you, and your heart will leave full. Cheers to making memories in the heart of the Big Apple! 🌟",New York
ChIJR9So-lRYwokRX1xEjA0rChA,Justin Antonietti,5,"I'm just going to start this off by saying do not order your own dish. This place is most certainly meant to share. With many other people. Largest portions I've ever seen at any restaurant by far. The food was phenomenal, service was incredible, atmosphere was fantastic. Our party of 4 shared 2 entrees and a salad and each and every one of us left with to-go boxes. I would return here in a heartbeat. I wish we had something even similar on the way coast. Also the eggplant parmesan was the best I've ever eaten! Drink were also great.",New York
ChIJR9So-lRYwokRX1xEjA0rChA,James Hustis,5,We've been to New York a few times and this is the best of the best. Our server even tells you that their dishes are in large portions and we should simply share which is what we did. Cheese Ravioli is second to none. The sauce is home maid and really delicious. I ordered a couple Meat Balls on the side and you'll NEVER find anything like these anywhere else. They served us up a bread basket with their home made breads that are out of this world. Prices are really good as well. Treat yourself to a great real meal and go see the folks at Carmine's. You'll be glad you did.,New York
ChIJ09ZGju5YwokRXOcNC23JRwk,Courtney Dziersk,5,"We had a great experience at Daniel! While we are not new to fine dining, this was our first Michelin star experience. We loved the food, appreciated the extra courses brought out & especially loved the carefully selected wine pairings.
The service wasn’t perfect - it took a long time from being seated to receiving menus and ordering drinks. We had been at the table for 45 min before we were finally able to order anything. We had a late reservation, so I think they were just overwhelmed when we arrived. The service did drastically improve after we placed our order.
I highly recommend the 4 course option, as my partner and I each chose different dishes and were able to taste a ton of different dishes between the 2 of us. We left extremely full!",New York
ChIJ09ZGju5YwokRXOcNC23JRwk,Greg Tam,5,"Daniel is one of the best restaurants I've been to in my life. I went with my girlfriend for our anniversary. We had the mindblowing tasting menu, which included 7 courses, and a whole assortment of other dishes and desserts they surprised us with. At the recommendation of a friend, we decided to do the wine pairing and share it between the two of us. That was easily more than enough, given how many dishes there were. Each wine complemented their corresponding dish perfectly. The waiters were even kind of enough to top our glasses up even when we didn't ask for it. Topnotch service. They were also very attentive, folding our napkins if we left the table and helping us to push our seats in when we sat down.

By the end of the meal, we were both completely stuffed. They kept giving us more food and desserts that were not listed on the menu. We were also definitely feeling the effects of the wine pairing we split. I don't even know how someone can do a single wine pairing on their own. It's way too much alcohol. My biggest pet peeve with fine dining is it's often not filling. But Daniel was so worth its high cost.

Their tasting menu changes every season, so I definitely plan to come back for another amazing dining experience.",New York
ChIJ09ZGju5YwokRXOcNC23JRwk,Gary Choy,5,"My fiancee and I celebrated my birthday and our recent engagement here. They gave us a sofa table (only 4 of them in restaurant)

The sommelier was knowledgeable of the wines and gave us great recommendations to match the menu.

Our waiter's service was beyond first class. He ensured our wine glasses were always filled, and our food came out in a timely manner.

We had the tasting menu and everything was presented well and delicious. We had our selections of bread to go along with the meal.

By desert, we were full already.

As my first time going to a two star Michelin restaurant, it did not disappoint and it was a once in a life time experience. I did not know fine dining until I came to Daniel",New York
ChIJ09ZGju5YwokRXOcNC23JRwk,To To Tran,5,"Everything was absolutely amazing and beyond expectations! The foie-gras was the best one I’ve ever had. Immense selection of cheeses with refreshing cocktails made by undoubtedly professional bartenders.

ChIJq58thpNZwokRcsvqjnNzYcc,Bhav,5,"Really good food and excellent venue. Very lively on a Friday night but service was still prompt and attentive.

Escargot was fantastic as was the standard roast chicken on the menu. We also got a steak and marrow share plate special which was fantastic. Mashed potatoes and fries were great as well.

Definitely recommend.",New York
ChIJq58thpNZwokRcsvqjnNzYcc,Stephan Grütering,5,"Yesterday around 1 pm, i was walking the Village, and became hungry. I saw this place. My gut was saying this could be good. I went inside this place was really beautiful, for NYC it is gigantic.
I had a very nice waiter from Croatia. As an entree I ordered a salad, the crunchyness of the onion rings combined with the salad sauce was fantastic. The french pasta dish (I did not even know they had pasta) and its simple but very delish sauce was to die for. The price was 70 Dollars. Around lunch you need no reservation, dinner you definetly need a reservation.",New York

ChIJq58thpNZwokRcsvqjnNzYcc,Nyc Driver,5,"Best restaurant we could’ve ever chosen for a romantic and delicious evening- specially on Thanksgiving! The ambiance woos you away as soon as you walk in with all the holiday decor. I definitely experienced more than I expected, their turkey and Australian rib eye steak dishes were cooked to perfection; we didn’t miss our traditional home cooked holiday meal! This whole evening couldn’t have came together as perfectly as it did without the help of such a great team of staff, reservations all flowed at ease- while constantly busy, and food was served fast yet exquisite!! Rebecca really stood out to me, she was clearly the manager at a glance; very focused on every clients satisfaction- myself being one of them!! She was very personable and and endearing, the rare kind of manager that is worth more than an average business can imagine, and worth being stolen for a much bigger business endeavor!!! Management is the main key for a successful establishment; come here for an example!
Will be back many, many, many, more times!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Top steak restaurant on my list now.🙌🙏",New York
ChIJV7QQ6kdZwokRax4615zpSGU,Pris Nggz,4,"I had high expectations for this restaurant.

Pros:

The appetizers were very tasty, my favourite was the complimentary soup. The portions were just right.

I liked that you have different options for your dinner. It was kinda like a set menu but you have the freedom to choose different dishes for your meal.

The flavours were good for some of the dishes, I felt like they were trying to play with different cuisines. It was not only French but a little bit of Asian, for example the shrimps with coconut sauce. A bit of Caribbean with the fruits added to the dessert.

Cons:

Although the service was good I felt rushed because you have to decide all your options at the beginning of your meal with the little time provided.

They served bread but it’s cold.

Some of the dishes tasted good but it wasn’t like wow either.

Some of the desserts were an interesting take on Asian styled desserts. But the balance of sweet and sour was off as the dessert was sour.

The linen on the table is old and worn out. It was not comfortable to touch nor look at as there were lint all over the middle of the table. Being a high end restaurant, we were expecting a lot more for attention to details.",New York
ChIJV7QQ6kdZwokRax4615zpSGU,Jasna Acharya,5,"Wow - everything was exceptional!

We went here for our anniversary. Everything from the food to the service was top notch.

The service was polished, attentive, knowledgeable, and professional.

We highly highly recommend getting the wine pairing with the chef’s 8 course tasting menu. The wine paired perfectly with every dish we had and it really enhanced the flavor of every bite we had.

Pro tip - do not eat or drink anything prior. Don’t let those small plates fool you. We were really full from all the courses, that I had to ask for my dessert to go! The plates look small, but trust me you’ll be full by the end of it. This is in the best way possible! You’ll get your moneys worth.

And as for the wine pairing, they will pour solid glasses, so do not and I repeat do not go to a happy hour prior. Don’t even have one drink prior. Towards the end of the meal I had to ask my husband to help me finish my wine because their pours were generous. (As it should be, you’ll get your moneys worth!).

I can go on and on about the caviar, perfectly cooked and seasoned fish, the jus, etc. every bite is intentional and I am just so happy I got to experience their art and passion.",New York
ChIJV7QQ6kdZwokRax4615zpSGU,For a Whale,3,"Was there for my birthday dinner, had to say my hope was too high.
Our reservation was around 8pm, fully packed with people upon on arrival.
First impression is busy, servers were running around and helping different tables, we have been served by three or four people throughout the dinner, attentive service.
Expected quieter and romantic ambience but reality is the contrary.
Had the 8 course tasting menu, first two courses were exceptional, especially the tuna jelly, fine texture with layers of after taste, crunchiness  brought out rich scallion tuna. Followed by the third and fourth course, scallop caviar, juicy 🫶🏻 however, fifth course lobster taste like Thai curry, Asian fusion I guess? Not to mention the last two fish, one was over cooked, lost all its tenderness. Kinda ruined my appetite.
Cocktails were excellent.
We spent around 500 for each person, I definitely had higher expectation but left with disappointment. If this is on your list, order different dishes rather than having tasting menu.",New York
ChIJV7QQ6kdZwokRax4615zpSGU,Eias Murad,4,"Le Bernardin is a seafood paradise at its finest. I was lucky to come here for lunch and dinner to assess consistency in service, taste and cooking. I am a seafood aficionado, the flavors here were spectacular. Sauces were savory and complex, complimented fish very well. Wine pairings and choices were above average, there’s a mistake in one of the pairings at dinner. Ambience is luxurious, buzzing and relatively loud. Service was good but lacked consistency between lunch and dinner. I felt some staff and sommelier seemed a bit busy, rushed or overwhelmed. Desserts were good but nothing was unique or distinguishable for a three starred restaurant. Overall, I was satisfied with the seafood courses but experience was slightly subpar when compared to other three Michelin stars restaurants I have been to, they just didn’t push their gastronomical boundaries. The “wow” or “truly exceptional” factor was missing especially in wine, service and desserts.",New York
ChIJV7QQ6kdZwokRax4615zpSGU,Ariel Flores,2,"I had high expectations for this restaurant as it is one of the world’s top rated Michelin starred restaurants. We did the chefs tasting menu. The first 2 courses were great but it all went downhill from there. The lobster course was absolutely awful. The lobster was very over cooked. The sauce was supposed to be curry and lemongrass, it tasted like bland tomato water. We sent it back and they comped us a “truffle” pasta course which was even worse. During truffle season, it had no trace of truffle and the boxes pasta they served us was literally crunchy. The remaining courses lacked freshness and flavor and we ultimately ate somewhere else for dinner. We had gone there for our anniversary and the wait staff didn’t even acknowledge what we were celebrating until the very end. They brought out a pathetic little cupcake for us to share. For a 3 Michelin starred restaurant, it was NOT worth the hype. I’m convinced they bought that accolade.",New York
ChIJU3gRuXpZwokRihNyTYLnc1g,Christopher Eu,5,"Love this place but i bristle a bit at their weird ‘one fish and chips per table’ rule - we had a table for 5! The very least they could have done was let us order two to share. Its unfortunately what most people come to and know this place for, so i understand the policy to limit the number of fish and chip orders, so that you don’t even up with large tables all getting the same thing. To be fair, everything else we ordered was absolutely incredible and i don’t regret coming here (for the 3rd time). I just think the kitchen could have been a little bit more flexible given that we were a larger party. In any case, oysters with chartreuse were great, desserts were great, everything is great. Long live dame.",New York
ChIJU3gRuXpZwokRihNyTYLnc1g,Tammy Liu,5,"My absolute favourite place for seafood in this city.

It can be so hard to get seafood right in this country but Dame does every dish right. The seating is limited so definitely get a reservation but once you’re there order anything off the menu and you should have a good time, especially if you’re already a seafood lover.

Both myself and my not-as-seafood-loving counterpart really enjoyed the meal, and so being able to find that right balance between our tastes is an impressive feat in itself.

I’d definitely recommend the fish & chips at the very least. The crispiest and softest fish & chips I’ve ever had! I also really liked the clams in wine.",New York
ChIJU3gRuXpZwokRihNyTYLnc1g,RJ Doidge,5,"A perfect meal on a gorgeous late summer evening. The hostess was so friendly and helpful when I reach out to say we were going to be about 20 minutes late. Every single bite of food was delicious, but I must give it up for the squid skewers and the fish and chips. I don’t know how they managed to make such a substantial piece of fish (hake, we asked) so perfectly light and tender. The potatoes were similarly incredible, especially dipped in the homemade tartar sauce. I’m already dreaming about when I can go back…",New York
ChIJU3gRuXpZwokRihNyTYLnc1g,Alex Wiley,5,"We've had the opportunity to eat here twice and loved both times. The fish and chips are a must, the breading on the fish is ethereally light and crispy. Other dishes are perfectly prepared with bright flavors that complement the seafood. Get whatever version of tuna is on the menu and don't skip dessert. The strawberry trifle with black peppercorn meringue haunts my dreams.",New York
ChIJU3gRuXpZwokRihNyTYLnc1g,Angela Baldwin,5,"I almost didn't want to write this review.  It was hard enough securing a reservation at this small venue which seats less than 30 in doors, and I don't want any additional competition for my next visit.  But alas, my higher nature has prevailed and I will share my experience at this tiny jewel of a restaurant.  Don't let the casual decor fool you, the cuisine is definitely elevated.  I sat at the bar with a prime view of the open kitchen and the staff constantly moving about like a team of whirling dervishes, energetically whipping up delectable dishes.

I started with a grilled oyster with green chartreuse hollandaise.  Even if you're not a fan of oysters, I highly recommend this appetizer.  The oyster was perfectly grilled so the texture was not too slimy, not too rubbery, but just right.  The chartreuse hollindaise provided a bit of citrus and herbaceous flavor, and just the right touch of sweetness.  There was a real harmony of flavors that made this simple preparation quite the clever dish.

The squid and scallion skewers were also very enjoyable.  Pro tip: use the freshly toasted sourdough bread to sop up the olive oil and herb based concoction poured over skewers for an additional delightful treat.

The smoked whitefish croquettes were a game changer!  I had no idea whitefish could be so juicy and flavorful!  The fried golden crust had a crunch more satisfying than a potato chip, making the croquettes more addictive than a can of Pringles.  I would've gladly noshed on a bowl of those all night, but then I may not have had room for the best fish and chips I've ever had in my life.

The fish was exquisitely battered so that the desired texture was present, but not overdone (I despise taking a bite of fried fish only to have a mouthful of fried batter).  The gleaming fish inside was faultless, appropriately flaky and succulent with a mild flavor that was drawn out by the added malt vinegar.  The accompanying chips were warm, crips on the outside and appropriately soft inside, each one, a bite of delight.  You've heard of chef's kiss, but this actually made me want to kiss the fish!

The skate cheek kabab was flavorful with marinated peppers and yogurt.  The flavor profile was very reminiscent of Mediterranean cuisine.

The tender baked cod was exemplary and complimented by hearty butter beans and delectable chunks of savory bacon.

The veritable expertise in seafood displayed during my experience blew me away.  I'd happily return....if I'm lucky enough to secure a reservation again.",New York
ChIJBUwsto1ZwokRsW3Dy0Y1cO0,Albina,4,Scallops and steak w fries were great. Definitely recommend those two. Pass on the beet salad and oysters.  Super pricey spot.  Check menu prices for their tapas style dishes so there's no sticker shock :),New York
ChIJBUwsto1ZwokRsW3Dy0Y1cO0,Joshua Daniel,5,"Had the famous burger and some drinks, loved everything about it. Walked in at 1pm and luckily got the last two seats at the bar immediately, the people that came in after us were given “about an hour wait” for walk in seats. The medium rare felt more like a medium and would try it rare next time. The challah bun, the black pepper, the cheese, all perfect. Comparable in quality to the Dirty French burger. Bravo, will be back.",New York
ChIJBUwsto1ZwokRsW3Dy0Y1cO0,Big Nick,5,"What a great spot! My new girlfriend tells me this is a must try, the steak is like nothing she has ever had before.

ChIJBUwsto1ZwokRsW3Dy0Y1cO0,Hunter Johnson,5,"I’ve got to say that the service here is world class. Eddie is the best. He is welcoming to everyone even when it’s full, he’s so gracious, patient and welcoming. He’s a true ambassador for the establishment. Franco, behind the bar is world class. He’s engaging, kind and creates a great atmosphere. Very few places in the world have one staff member like this but to have two is very rare/special.

The meal was very good, the steak truly never misses.

Our only odd disappointment was that we never were asked if we wanted another round of drinks at all and could not get our server until dessert was offered.

Still, a great meal and such a fun spot.",New York
ChIJ0yKXaB9awokR6WFqdEE9aBY,Ramya Shenoy,4,Great place to get Creole food. I had the vegan jambalaya and the jerk cauliflower tacos. My partner tried the jambalaya with chicken and sausage. The vegan jambalaya had pineapples and cashews which added a nice flavor to it. The tofu in the vegan jambalaya was the star! We also had the bread pudding for desert and I would definitely recommend it. Overall a great place for dinner.,New York
ChIJ0yKXaB9awokR6WFqdEE9aBY,Alessandra Distefano,5,"Really good late night restaurant. Quick service and nice atmosphere. The food was delicious.

There is an outdoor space as well.",New York
ChIJ0yKXaB9awokR6WFqdEE9aBY,Albert Wang,5,"Dropped by on a whim the other day. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, service and the overall ambience.

We ended up sharing a tuna nicoise salad and a rack of baby back ribs between two. The ribs came with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw. The amount of food was more than enough for two.

The highlights for me was definitely the mac and cheese and coleslaw. The ribs were still good, but the sides were GREAT.

Service was good, no-nonsense. Atmosphere was nice with a live jazz band.

I'd definitely recommend anyone looking for a good feed and good vibes to drop by.",New York
ChIJ0yKXaB9awokR6WFqdEE9aBY,Brian Tran,5,"One of the best places in NYC for good food, good service and live music.
The charbroiled oysters were delicious, full of butter sauce on a bed of lettuce and bread. Excellent!
Gumbo was very good as well. The shrimp Po boy es good but could have more shrimps. The
The begnets we're good but it could be a bit lighter and fluffier.
Overall I've if the better modern Cajun food. Prices were reasonable.
There were outside seating and beautifully decorated restaurants. On the mezzanine is where a small band would play.
Protip. Weekends there is live music. Check with the restaurant for times. Reservations are needed. It's busy. We went late lunch after 2.30pm and there was no waiting.",New York
ChIJ0yKXaB9awokR6WFqdEE9aBY,Tamiko Ramirez,5,I don’t know where to begin on how wonderful my friends and I ate at this restaurant. We seriously underestimated how great this restaurant turned out. Everything we had from the drinks to dessert was extremely delicious. My friend ordered the Hurricane. He liked it very much. I ordered the Summer Sangria. It was very yummy. My other close friend ordered the Purple Reign. She liked it so much that she ordered it a second time. Then came the appetizers. Honestly I’ve never had Creole food so I was really excited to try it and my anticipation paid off. My friend ordered the Gumbo. We all completely fell in love with it. We literally fighting each other for the shrimp. Lol! The Gumbo was so good that I ordered a second plate to take home. I ordered the Jambalaya. Seeing that it was my first time trying it I really enjoyed it. My friend ordered the XO noodles. He really liked it. My other friend ordered the Bouillabaisse. She savored it. She loved dipping her bread into the sauce. I noticed how generous the portions are. The Gumbo can be a meal in itself. We all took our leftovers home with us. For dessert we ordered the beignets and the bread pudding. We all agreed the bread was the hit of the entire meal. It was so delicious! Our server was extremely nice and attentive to us. I can go on and on of all the great things about this restaurant. I can’t recommend this restaurant highly enough. Everyone should experience it for themselves.,New York

ChIJL6-NTmBZwokRGacx3GWq3D0,Natalie Park,4,"We visited Frevo for my partner’s birthday, loved the ambiance, and the speak-easy style entrance door in the beginning.

Overall the food was great. The plating was very colorful and artistic. We typically like to eat different seafoods, and there were lots of courses that included seafoods during my visit. Plus, the somm went over different options and gave us a good recommendation. Loved the overall experience.

One minus star- because we felt the pace was a bit inconsistent through out the course. We felt little rushed between the amuse bouche course, and a bit of pause before the main dish (duck course).

Also, we wished there were at least one “lower” (~$100) priced range wine bottle on the drink menu. We’ve been to many Michelin star restaurants, but this place was one of the pricy side for the drinks menu.",New York
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Justin Bass,5,"This was quite possibly the best serviced meal I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating. And the food was incredible. We ate family styled and tried so many dishes. The highlights for me were the porkchop, the sourdough bread with truffle butter and bone marrow gravy, and the gnocchi. We also had the tomahawk steak, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and squid ink pasta. For dessert the upside down cake was excellent. The cocktail to try is the self titled Otium. Its light citrus flavor with Japanese whisky was perfect.",Los Angeles

*Naan (amazing)
*Prawns (OK, we are used to great seafood and this wasn't anything special flavour-wise
*PB&J funnel cake (amazing)
*Steak tartare (OK, the base crunch was way too hard and there was not much steak vs other ingredients ratio)
*Gnocchi (really good, served a bit more greasy than expected)
*Pork chop (amazing, we wanted the duck but it was sold out for the night, this dish didn't disappoint and I would highly recommend it)
*Potatoes (prepared ""smashed"" style, delicious)
*Squash (good, but potatoes are way better)
*Carrots (delicious if you are ok with curry flavour)
* Samoa pudding
* Chocolate tart",Los Angeles

Lively atmosphere, but whoever designed the acoustics nailed it; easy to have a conversation- highly recommend",Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Maria,5,The restaurant is a tucked away delightful gem. The ambiance is light & breezy with an upscale feel. The staff is attentive and the food was nicely portioned and cooked fresh. Price points are good for their selections.,Los Angeles
ChIJ_RTRaE3GwoARPBWnFhO44DQ,Tommy Lei Studio,5,"Otium is an incredibly satisfying meal, albeit with some pretty steeped price points. We come here 2-3 times a year as a treat or special date night. Get the naan or Otium crispy potatoes as starters. For mains, the pastas are a no brainer. The seafood items on the menu are quite extraordinary and seasonal. If it’s available, get the heirloom tomato tart - simply sublime. Cocktail and wine program are very strong - but again pricey. This is definitely a restaurant to budget for, but so worth the splurge!",Los Angeles
ChIJG5wBgrfHwoARO_TfGQqe4xM,Hauuguu,5,"Thanksgiving 3-course dinner was delicious! We added on Mac n Cheese but it came with everything else in this picture. The turkey had a choice between white and dark meat, the cranberry sauce was nice and sweet, the bread they came with had pumpkin and cream cheese butter spreads, etc!

Only problem was the 30 min wait at the entrance even though we had a reservation, but they did come with some free steak skewer samples so that was nice.

Overall great experience, waiter was very nice too although he kept coming at the worst times to interrupt the middle of our conversation lol.",Los Angeles
ChIJG5wBgrfHwoARO_TfGQqe4xM,J Bianca,5,"Waiter made our visit incredible! I watched him work like 10 tables and he was attentive to everyone. He made sure our food was hot and everything was perfect. His suggestions was tasteful! Everything he was selling I was buying! That’s how good he was!

The food! I ordered the New York strip steak with the chipotle mac and cheese and the brussels sprouts. Flavorful and scrumptious. My daughter enjoyed her filet mignon. Overall this was a great experience.",Los Angeles

ChIJG5wBgrfHwoARO_TfGQqe4xM,Robinson Mail,2,Visited Flemings on my b day for an early lunch customer service was great ! Juan the waiter was good .. I ordered the wedge salad it was. 10 out of 10 fresh and delicious the bread tasted old and stale .. the crab cakes were cold and lack taste ..the Mac and cheese was ok nothing special . The filet mignon was cold and looked old lastly I ordered the bbq shrimp didn’t like the taste shrimp were hard none of my food was hot and they had just open.  My ticket for the meal was about 130.00 and 25 $ for parking the view was nice,Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Grace Markham,5,"The manager was lovely and made some great recommendations.

But I was very impressed with the level of great service from our waiter Carlos. He was on the ball the entire evening and made sure everything went perfectly smooth from start to finish. Genuinely good service by someone who has perfected his trade.

The ambiance is also great here.
The menu is delightful for seafood lovers, and we indulged in some lobster, crab, and a selection of oysters and other things.
Everything was done perfectly and tasted delicious.
I also had a steak (who doesn't love a little surf and turf) and they do them perfectly as well! (Oh and don't sleep on the chimichurri) overall a 10/10 experience.  We would definitely return.",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Marlene Viola,5,"Wow, What an experience! If your looking at reviews to see if it is worth a try... look no further. Normally I would not call eating at a restaurant an ""experience"", but this was extraordinary. Chris, our server, introduced us to the most amazing oysters we have ever had. I tried them a few times in the past (other restaurants) with no delight ... but these, Wow!  We also had the clams which were just as fabulous. The broth was delicious. Our main meals were the Chilean sea bass and a Lobster. Everything was fantastic! And we could not have had better service.
Even if you go for a few appetizers - go for it!!!!",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Judy Webb,5,"Every single aspect of our visit was exceptional!  Champagne was icy cold and bubbly!  Salads were ""tossed"" not doused!  Fish expertly prepared. All sides were excellent.   AC worked great.  SERVICE WAS PERFECT.  One member of our party has severe food allergies and our server took them very seriously!  Not enough room for dessert but I would bet it was perfect too!",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Mario Garcia-Gillespie,3,"Dinner here was good, but come here for drinks and dessert. I did expect more than what I got, but that is part of the experience. The food was okay. I had expected more spices and flavor from the stew and from the seafood. The crab was over cooked and the oysters were not cleaned well enough or detached from the shell. The lobster was very good and cooked perfectly. They have a wide selection of drinks and desserts and that is where they shine. Drinks were well balanced, clean and high quality. The banana pudding was really good and that is considering I'm not a big fan of carmel. Not too sweet and a great balance of salt.",Los Angeles
ChIJx-cckLTHwoARfAkrqMmW2So,Rissa H,5,"The water grill specializes in seafood, including sushi, oysters and several types of shellfish. I had the tuna poke to start and it was perhaps one of the best over had. Very large portion compared to other places. Would have been enough for a main for me. I then followed it up with the King salmon roll served with an incredible soy lime vinaigrette. This was very different and a welcomed difference. I didn’t have dessert as I was stuffed. They start you off with a sourdough bun topped with sea salt. This was again very good. I will definitely go here again.",Los Angeles
ChIJvVvovUvGwoARYrOMSp23rpQ,Julie Vawter,5,"Our group of 6 had excellent food and service. We all tasted each others dishes and vow to go back to try more. Fresh pasta, made on site. But go early...no reservations.",Los Angeles
ChIJvVvovUvGwoARYrOMSp23rpQ,C Covarrubias,4,"First time here and was lucky to end up in a very nice and delicious place like this. My 2 kids and I ordered the Boccoletti Al Pesto E Ricotta, Rigatoni Pom'Amore, Maccheroni and Cheese. For dessert we shared a flourless chocolate cake and I ordered a cappuccino. Everything was delicious. I'm no ""food expert"", but I'd give this place 4-4.5 out of 5 stars. We got lucky and got last sitting for lunch (5 minutes before the closed). Place inside is somewhat small, but in most cases that's what makes it quaint and feel more homey. Our waiter was nice, but I could tell that they were ready to just close. Overall it was a great experience!",Los Angeles
ChIJvVvovUvGwoARYrOMSp23rpQ,Yellow Bluebonnet,5,"The staff was great and the pasta was phenomenal! Their osso con bucco tasted great and the portion sizes are generous. Do not pass on dessert! The flan, cheesecake, and chocolate cake are amazing. Ingredients and cheese and olive oil are nice",Los Angeles
ChIJvVvovUvGwoARYrOMSp23rpQ,Imaan,5,"The pasta here is really good, worth returning to. All freshly made in-house. The garlic bread also was yummy. There can be a long wait so I recommend coming during a weekday or lunch to avoid that. Not sure why they haven't started any kind of reservation system, at this point, every restaurant in LA is on either OpenTable or Resy. Parking in this area is not fun, area can be sketchy at night if you are a female by yourself.",Los Angeles
ChIJvVvovUvGwoARYrOMSp23rpQ,Sadé Hinton-Morris,5,"I wasn't having the greatest luck finding food on a work trip UNTIL I came across this gem. The food was fresh and delicious. The staff were friendly and made sure I was comfortable. I had their signature dish and it was so good, I came back the next day to try another dish. The 2nd time, I made sure to leave room for dessert. Haha. The atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. Would definitely recommend.",Los Angeles
ChIJgegyNVrHwoARkEbBhAI03ok,Athena Press,5,"Tasteful atmosphere and very good service, this was after the lunch rush hour.
The crowd varies depending on the time, but I'd say it is more on the high end of things.
I hear during lunch rush hour the place is packed with people who work nearby so time yourself and unless strictly necessary don't come  between 11:45am and 12:30pm.
Downs:Music a bit loud (A too frequent nuissance these days in bars)
I liked their tea service and that they actually had tea.
I ordered chinese chicken salad, and I'd sincerely give it a 4,  ot a 5 but,hey this is not a chinese food join.
I'm totally coming back.
Another note: Parking is challenging in this area, and this restairant-bar does not offer validation.",Los Angeles
ChIJgegyNVrHwoARkEbBhAI03ok,Praneet Raj,5,"We loved the lunch here. Everything was amazing.

ChIJgegyNVrHwoARkEbBhAI03ok,Zombie Bölverkr,4,"Came for lunch with my coworkers.  The overall restaurant was nice, it is a short walk from our work location.

The food: I ordered the 7-hour bolognese and it was good, not anything special.  It was very oily, which affected me later in the day and not in a good way.  My coworkers ordered the burger, to which she stated the highlight was the bread, and the others ordered the chicken  sandwich, where they said it was ok.  Overall, I'm not sure if I would return.

The service: it was almost absent. It was nice at the beginning, and then became lack luster after we received the food.  We asked for more water from several servers, and it never came.  Also, when they brought the check, they never returned, and they were focused on cleaning the restaurant over assisting us.

The atmosphere: standard, it was a bar first based on the looks before it added the restaurant side of things.",Los Angeles
ChIJgegyNVrHwoARkEbBhAI03ok,Alex Puc,5,"Hill Street Bar & Restaurant is a hidden gem for beer lovers! The service was exceptional, with staff who were more than willing to provide recommendations and make us feel welcome. The quality of the beer selection was remarkable, offering a broad spectrum of flavors and styles. What's even more remarkable is the value – you can enjoy high-quality brews without straining your wallet. A fantastic place to unwind and savor great beer.",Los Angeles

We ordened Bife de Chorizo and Provoleta too 10/10.

ChIJq3j4WYLHwoARV7LbuJTus58,Daniela Martinez,1,"This LALA’s location does not do the others justice. We stopped in on our way home from LAX, the melrose location is temporarily closed. As usual the melrose salad was good. My son ordered the entraña. I should have sent it back immediately, it was butterflied. ?? Never in decades of eating entraña, including at LALA’s, has this cut of meat ever been butterflied. Why would they do this? It ruined a usually great piece of meat. As an Argentine I was embarrassed they even allowed this to come out of their kitchen.
I’m angry that I didn’t send it back. People go out to dinner for a nice meal, a nice time. Not to have to complain or pay for a steak that is essentially jerky. Argentine’s are known for their meat, their barbecue. Even well done they’re are never burned, they are usually cooked to perfection. Our waitress was good, but no one else provided any customer service or even a hello.
Very disappointed and frustrated.
I hope to hear a reply. This is the first time I’ve ever given LALA’s a bad review, hope someone is paying attention.
Even in the restaurants pictures the entraña is NOT butterflied. Huge mistake.",Los Angeles
ChIJq3j4WYLHwoARV7LbuJTus58,MaNu,4,"Lala’s is a popularly recognized Argentinian cuisine restaurant in L.A. for its unmatched and delicious meat cuts just as you would have in Argentina. The Chimichurri is exceptional. You will not stop dipping everything in it. The food is delicious. Portion size is fine. It’s pricey, but fair enough for its reputation. Initially, when we were trying to order the waiter did give us a bit of sass for having some basic questions but nothing too out handed. The location is a bit rough since it is DTLA. Also, the restaurant itself is a bit tight, maybe not suitable for large groups. There is paid parking across the street, and rarely possible some street parking. Over all, we had a good experience.",Los Angeles
ChIJq3j4WYLHwoARV7LbuJTus58,Scott Alan Hardy,5,"Edwardo has created the restaurant I knew as a child. Delicious, new takes on old world food and the ability to grille meat perfectly.

I ordered “Don’t think, just eat” option and added about three different dishes that weren’t in my meal option. All the sushi pieces were ever fresh and delicious.  The proportions are on point and the flavors are phenomenal.

I’d definitely come back here again and try their other menu items. Overall it was we a solid dining experience.

Parking is very limited & you’d be lucky to find some on the street or you can get nearby paid parking.",Los Angeles

ChIJqWzcR7THwoARg7eO0wui4tM,Ephraim Su,1,Food here is very sub-par. Expected a nice omakase style meal left to find average sushi. Prob can get better at an Asian super market.

There is absolutely no reason to over marinade sashimi unless there is something to hide.,Los Angeles

ChIJtRpiCTjGwoAR_-NpLZuQpiM,Angelica Le,4,"Overall: 4.2/5 (Postmates delivery)

The food delivered earlier than expected. I liked the food but had better. However, I was able to get a huge chunk of my daily vegetable intakes from it so I'm happy.

Doner Basket ($16.75): The portion is huge so we had leftovers enough for another meal. Their fried pita stick was hard so I wasn't a fan. You can customize your fries so we got mixed sweet potato and regular fries. The sweet potato fries are the waffle version and were clearly better than the regular fries where were starchy. We got beef, lamb, and chicken for our protein. Beef and lamb gyros were thinly sliced while the chicken was cut into cubes. The lamb didn't have a smell or gamey taste while the chicken was dry. I also didn't really like their falafel mix. The rest of the toppings went well with the salad.

Street Cart Diner Wrap ($14.75): This was a big wrap that they cut in 2 for you; I ate one of the halves and was full. For my protein, I got beef, lamb, and chicken and felt that this wrap had more meat than veggies while the reverse is true for the Doner Basket. Nothing really stood to me about the wrap; everything blended in to create a homogenous wrap. I think there was a lot more flavors in the Doner Basket.

Single Doquito ($7.50): This actually comes with 2 rolls and was the best item out of everything we ate. This is way better and like an elevated version of the Mexican taquito. A Doquito is a fried lavish bread rolled in feta, onion, and aioli.  The flavors were on point and it was fried to perfection. It didn't get soggy even with all the additional toppings smothered on top.",Los Angeles
ChIJtRpiCTjGwoAR_-NpLZuQpiM,Alicia M,5,"First time here. My son and I had lunch. Cooks and waiters were friendly, the place was clean, love that they have self serve water and doggie bag items available++ and the food was delicious!
Had the Remix bowl with beef and lamb; their lemon dressing sauce was amazing! My son had the Berliner bowl They had three different sangrias available my son had the white sangria and he said it was good.
Nice music, people, and space to eat outside if you like.",Los Angeles
ChIJtRpiCTjGwoAR_-NpLZuQpiM,Cesar Salazar,5,Love the berliner wrap doner with beef and lamb drinks are good too the lavender mojito and cucumber margarita are really good,Los Angeles
ChIJtRpiCTjGwoAR_-NpLZuQpiM,Moses Soto,5,"My wife and I have been coming to this place a couple of times now. Time Saver: Order online! Seating is available inside and out. Some regular tables and high chairs (for adults) are available inside. There is a seated bar area as well.

The environment is interestingly decorated (it's nice!). The folks working behind the counter are welcoming and patient with the customers reading the menu. Parking is on a first come first served basis on the street metered parking. There are parking garages throughout the area.

Food is delicious. Soft drinks are good. The alcoholic beverages look even better. I have yet to try them :)

Overall, a good place to escape the other common restaurants located around.

Thank you and God Bless.",Los Angeles
ChIJMc9-jgrIwoARvFaE32ZlJzA,Kevin Marroquin,5,My experience to this restaurant was perfect 100 percent. Good food and the The combination of seafood with sauces and soups was very good. I recommend that you try everything.  That is if they don't sell any liquor here but a good place to go eat alone or with friends or with your partner.  There are different prices and flavors.  Also many tables to sit and they bring your food to the table.  I went 2 times but one of them I went alone and I spent about $90.00 including the tip,Los Angeles
ChIJMc9-jgrIwoARvFaE32ZlJzA,Somi Ezi-Ashi,5,I was in LA for 2 days and my gf insisted we go here. It was very worth it. I sat at the bar and you could see how carefully the chefs prepared the fish. The uni ceviche was super fresh and the smokes kanpachi was the best taco I’ve ever had in my life.,Los Angeles
ChIJMc9-jgrIwoARvFaE32ZlJzA,Elizabeth,5,I have the most delicious food here! We watched them cook from the bar.  They cooked the octopus from a charcoal grill. It came out so tender and soft. The scallop ceviche was tangy and spicy. Best ceviche I've ever had! The hot sauces are so good to!,Los Angeles
ChIJMc9-jgrIwoARvFaE32ZlJzA,Jeff Tong,5,"Fresh ingredients at reasonable pricing. The tacos here have a seafood freshness that seems to be missing from other local establishments. Nowhere else have we seen hanging whole tuna carcasses, feels like an aged steak fridge.

The service was quick. The ambiance was lively.",Los Angeles
ChIJMc9-jgrIwoARvFaE32ZlJzA,Kevin Webb,4,"Could have been an off day but this was not a Michelin star experience.   I'd have given it a 3.5 if Google had better rating system.  Food was a 3.   I had the lobster. Langosta al Carbon.  It was ok.  Dry, overcooked a bit.  Good not great and for 90 bucks, a pretty big disappointment .  Wife had the Collar and said it was also good, very good but not wow.  It was fine but for the price.....  Our guest had the Sopa de Marisco and if I go back that's what I'll have.  She said it was excellent.  This place is a good restaurant but it wouldn't make any top whatever list for me like it does all the local magazines.  Service was great and I love the Mercado Paloma itself.  Oh, the Ceviche was outstanding.  That's my thumbs up recommendation.",Los Angeles
ChIJKSPWlH-4woARrKJ5thvMBeY,J V,4,I had never been here before so I didn't even know this place was there. It's Mexican but not your typical Mexican food. The food was definitely different from what I have had before but unfortunately the food had way too much salt and on the expensive side. They really need to cut that salt and the tortillas got cold fast. Not too many choices if you're not use to this type of food. Also they only have a valet parking. No regular parking.,Los Angeles
ChIJKSPWlH-4woARrKJ5thvMBeY,PJ,5,Great vegetarian Tlayuda- flavors are good. Has a basil mushroom bean paste Oaxaca cheese... Mole is also flavorful and I am not a mole fan.

ChIJKSPWlH-4woARrKJ5thvMBeY,Nathaniel Valencia,5,"The food is always absolutely incredible. Been there twice and it keeps me wanting to come back to try it all.

ChIJKSPWlH-4woARrKJ5thvMBeY,Amanda Victoria,5,"Best Mole I’ve ever tried. Their carne asada it’s no really good but the mole and the rest of the food rescue our lunch here.

ChIJKSPWlH-4woARrKJ5thvMBeY,Krystina Vazquez,5,"Food:
Some of the best mole I have ever had. Absolutely love the menu and the variety you get. The menu explains exactly what you are getting from each mole. Starting from the chips topped with some mole to open your appetite. We ordered the queso fundido first. Then the Giant tostada enough to feed 2-3 people & my mole Colorado (chicken breast) was amazing.

Service:
We were seated immediately. Not long of a wait for a Friday night. The waiter took our drink order pretty quickly. We waited a little to order our main plates, but we're never left unattended.

Atmosphere:
I mean to top off except food and service..the place was just so much fun. The band they had that night was amazing and quite frankly the reason we stayed longer and racked up a bill of over $250. But don't be afraid of our total, we had more than our fair share of drinks.

I cannot wait to go back!!",Los Angeles

ChIJq0IHewzHwoARYMG4rYVPFlY,Karim Ahmed,4,"Badmaash is a great  chic spot for Indian food, I've been meaning to come since they are known for their Indian/American fusion dishes and those did not disappoint.

The Chicken Tikka Poutine was a favorite, and the burgers and Sandwiches were great. I'll agree with other reviews saying some menu items are overpriced (No one should be paying $5 for a single samosa). But there were great standouts on the menu (the fish curry, the lamb burger, the desserts), so by the end of the meal the prices evened out.

I also definitely recommend the chai to end your meal, since it's priced great ($2) and pairs great with dessert.",Los Angeles
ChIJwRa5GmzHwoARg3ny88Tv_NI,Daniel Facey,5,"So we were staying during California’s first hurricane in 85 years. They were still offering brunch, so we said what the heck! Tiffany was our server and did an excellent job in taking care of us. She offered splendid recommendations. We went with The Grand Breakfast, the Spanish inspired French toast, and the lobster roll. All of it was delicious! My French toast had an apricot jam that was just lovely, and accompanied by a greak yogurt whipped cream, that was dense yet light. The whipped cream was a terrific pairing and had the texture of yogurt but the aloofness of cream, it did not carry a strong aftertaste. The lobster roll was a decent portion, but I’ve had better will most certainly pass next time. My Father had the Grand breakfast, eggs fried hard, and opted for the chicken sausage which was great alternative. The breakfast potatoes were bomb! We finished out with this cream puff dessert that left us wanting more! That dessert didn’t see two minutes from when it left the kitchen! It was here today, gone tomorrow! Cost wise is going to be around $35 per person. Overall, a wonderful brunch experience and would definitely visit again.

Thank you, Tiffany!",Los Angeles

ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Doris Huang,3,"Overall, with this price, I was expecting a better quality. We spent a total of $850 for 6 people. Unlikely to visit again.
Service was great, very friendly servers. The style and vibe of the restaurant was really good, very fancy. (guess that's where I had too much expectation when walking in)
However, the entrees were very average to me. The sea bass/salmon I had: the tomato sauce is a very basic kind of tomato sauce, I can't taste the chef's effort. It did not surprise me at all. So did the salmon. Portion was way too small for an adult to feel full.
Desserts were better, they look amazing and taste great. Nothing to complain. Loved the 2 cakes in the pictures (sorry I can't recall what they'er called).",Los Angeles
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Michael Platz,5,"Literally cannot say enough about how great the food and experience is at Craft. Every person that we encountered during our time at Craft was so kind and genuinely seemed happy that we were there. The food was also top notch. Definitely recommend the waygu! The pork belly appetizer was also phenomenal, as well as the lamb entree. If you are looking for a great dining experience I couldn’t recommend Craft enough!",Los Angeles
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Aimee Wilkins,3,"The food here looks incredible! Every dish arrived at my table looking spectacular.

To start, I had an off menu octopus special and the hamachi. The octopus was one of the best I've ever had, not slimy or chewy at all. It was grilled to perfection with a beautiful char and exquisite flavor. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. Alongside it I had the fish which was light and fresh in a tasty jalepeno ponzu sauce.

For main courses I had the duck breast and lamb chop.  The dishes looked fantastic, especially the lamb chop. However, these were extremely small portions. The lamb was all of four bites and the duck was four small slices, not to mention dry as well. I was definitely wanting for more with the main courses.

The sides however made up for the tiny protein servings. I had the crispy potatoes and the ""Hen of the wild,"" a plate of oyster mushrooms. The potatoes were the star of the dinner. They were a hit - hot, crispy on the outside, soft inside and bursting with flavor. They were soooooo good. The mushrooms were also really tasty.

For dessert, I had the funnel cake with berries and sherbet. The flavors were good, but the funnel cake was a little oily for me.

Overall, the dinner was good. If you're really hungry, I'd say go somewhere else. Craft is definitely more of a quality over quantity kind of place.",Los Angeles
ChIJPV5ELvO7woARQhvThl3euQQ,Geronimo Carlo Ramos,3,"It was a Wednesday evening, late at night, when my parents and I stumbled upon this enchanting eatery tucked away in a sleepy neighborhood. Owned by none other than Tom Colicchio, the culinary mastermind behind Top Chef, my inner professional chef and devoted fan were bursting with anticipation.

The adventure commenced with a warm, aromatic gougere paired with our $3-per-person bread, which though a tad pricey, was a sign of a sophisticated gastronomic experience. The avocado salad, rich and creamy, dazzled our taste buds with the unexpected crunch and flavor of spiced peanuts.

Sharing a delightful trinity of mains - wagyu pasta, Chilean Seabass, and a side of earthy hen of the woods mushrooms - we were enraptured by the flavors before us. However, an initial hiccup with the undercooked Seabass left us puzzled. Though the staff graciously tried to remedy the situation, we still found it tough to cut, despite its mouthwatering taste. Thankfully, management's gracious gesture of comping the dish left us appreciative of their care.

The ambience was a symphony of soft, dim lights and a hushed, intimate atmosphere, all while being serenaded by the picturesque scenery outside. While the service was impeccable, the food - although delicious - didn't quite align with the premium price we paid. That said, this late-night discovery remains a captivating experience for any Top Chef fan seeking an unexpected culinary adventure.",Los Angeles
ChIJlVrraGC5woARiOX0x4ziZLo,Matthew Lawson,5,"The Jumbo Shrimp and Shrimp Tacos were well worth the wait! Enjoyed this while at Lincoln Beer Company's Space Night in Burbank. Didn't try it, but the chicken sandwich looked amazing! Just followed them on Instagram",Los Angeles
ChIJlVrraGC5woARiOX0x4ziZLo,Erica Holwick,1,"The food is food. The service and staff are horrid. They have *no reservations* about taking forever to make food. And *no reservations* about being rude to customers.

The chicken was fine and was crispy at least, but I would expect it to be if it takes 50 min to make. The waffles were very flat and a little burnt and the fries were limp and soggy.

We ordered their food at Lincoln Beer Company (great spot) and there were about 50-60 people here for the USA world cup game in the morning. Each time I went out to the truck, there was one or no people around it. I ordered at 7:55 and was told 25-30 min for chicken and waffles with a side of fries (that cost $28.50). I went out at 8:40 to check on it, and the two staff members were just watching the game in the truck and when I walked up, started fussing around with order tickets. They told me 5 more min. I commented that I ordered 45 min prior and they said ""well it's fresh chicken,"" as if it's a commonly accepted fact that 4 breaded chicken wings take an hour to make (spoiler alert: it doesn't).

I waited another 8-9 min and still hadn't heard anything via text. When I went out again, it looked like they were just finishing preparing an order. I asked if I could get a refund since the game I had come here for was almost over. I was met with a rude response of ""well your food is ready now, and we don't give refunds. We texted you five mins ago."" I told them that I did not get a text at all and checked again. Then I said okay, if the food is done then I'll take it but 55 min for food truck chicken and waffles is a bit ridiculous. And they got a little nasty in their tone saying ""it's fresh chicken and we had over 40 orders today and to check my texts."" (25 min later, still no text coming through despite consistently texting friends.)

I'm not sure the people running the truck understand the nature and appeal of a food truck - good food, somewhat quickly minus the headaches of a sit down restaurant. And I would say if you're going to get self-righteous about how long your food takes to make, it should be a little better than Waffle House waffles, elevated Popeye's chicken and soggy fries. I know of a couple of food trucks that are run by esteemed chefs, with menus way more complex that can turn food in 10-30 min max on days where a brewery is packed with 100+ people. A special 3 item menu for the world cup shouldn't be that hard to handle.

Don't eat here unless you have all day to wait for mediocre food and want to be spoken down to by the staff.",Los Angeles

Our server was lovely and gave us recommendations which were already the few we were torn between. I got the short rib hash and my partner got the basque eggs which was essentially a shakshuka with pulled short rib in it, both were absolutely delicious and a good portion size without feeling stuffed afterwards.

The modern mimosa is a must try, we were slightly confused when it arrived as it just looked like a glass of champagne but it was clarified orange juice, and was delicious! Definitely recommend it here and will come back to try the other brunch dishes too.",Los Angeles

The service was excellent— I sat down at the bar as soon as I arrived, and my waitress was incredibly kind, attentive, quick, and friendly to me.

Unfortunately the food didn't rate higher than a standard Italian chain. The pastas were undersalted. Overall, the dishes were under seasoned and plain, but not simple in a glorious way. Just plain.

The lady cutting the pork did not use gloves and was peeling the meat apart to put it in the taco shells (yes at this point we should of walked out). But with all the great reviews we really wanted to try it. The ladies did get a little attitude when we didn't want 2 of the shells cause of lent being on it then we didn't  want slaw on it just lettuce and cheese and that irritated her (I think we just had a little language barrier, and we apologized for that). I did not observe no one washing hands in-between drinking etc and making more tacos. The lady cleaning tables kept filling her cup up. When asked about refill they do not give you one but you can pay full price for another fountain drink (that would only cost maybe 5cents in syrup)  But they will give you a cup of ice for free, seems ridiculous. Not worth going back. Check out the ones by the vendors selling stuff. These ladies are not friendly",Los Angeles

The gnocchi was very soft and paired with the ricotta was perfect, and the bone marrow with the pasta was tasty (honestly thought they were green beans by accident).

Tartar and olives were both good.

Saffron pici, flavorful, a little bit salty.
Squid ink spaghetti, love the lemon, it was spicy and a little salty.

Bar seats are fun, you get to see all the action. Only thing is I wished the server would ask if we would like to keep the bread and olives before taking them away, there was still a good amount left and we wanted to take it to-go but it got thrown out instead.",Los Angeles
ChIJSRvZ1yHGwoARcLrfvc-APl4,Imaan,5,"An LA cult classic that actually lives up to the hype. Anticipate making your reservation far in advance, as it can be quite booked out.

I’m surprised this place doesn’t have some sort of Michelin recognition, as it is definitely at that level, in my humble opinion! Everything from the salad to the pizza and pasta was insanely delicious. We sat at the counter, which was extra fun because we got to watch the chefs prepping everything with such care and attention.

The restaurant's atmosphere is vibrant and trendy, with a rustic yet modern design that sets the stage for a memorable evening. The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic about the menu. Our server's recommendations were spot-on, helping us navigate the diverse options.

The standout feature here is the innovative menu. The small plates format allows you to explore a variety of flavors. We started with the wood oven-roasted pig face, which was a revelation - crispy, succulent, and bursting with unique flavors. The goat empanadas were another highlight, perfectly balanced in taste and texture.

The wine list is extensive, with an impressive array of choices to complement the dishes. The cocktails were equally inventive and refreshing.

The dessert selection is equally impressive; the chocolate chip bread pudding is a must-try for any sweet tooth.

Girl & The Goat is more than just a restaurant; it's a culinary adventure. With its creative menu, friendly staff, and a buzzing atmosphere, it's a top-tier dining experience in Chicago. Don't miss the opportunity to savor the creativity and passion of this gem. We'll be back for sure!",Chicago

Was happy they had a gluten free menu.

Really wanted to enjoy the food but every dish was way too salty.

Burrata e Ham is definitely their signature dish and the harmony of various different flavors and textures was memorable. Also tried the stuffed cabbage - interesting cuisine and was veggie cooked to give the heartiness of meat. One could see fresh pasta being made through the mirror - tried Tortelli di Zucca and Potato-filled Žlikrofi and liked fillings of both which were rich. My only complaint was that oil/butter seemed to be too lavishly applied to all the dishes (sans that burrata one) so that things became much less enjoyable after several bites.,Chicago

ChIJNYrg38UsDogRP1lxJuC05hw,Grace Lee,3,"We opted for a table, but they only got family style large ones for eight persons of each, so as a party of two, we ended up sharing. Small and limited space felt somewhat uncomfortable and awkward, hard to relax for being too close to others. Also I had to interrupt a lovely family sit by me to stand up and move so to let me out when leaving.

The lamb pizza was overly salty and lacked flavor (avoid ordering it), but we love chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates they were amazingly savory. You can order in half (2pcs) which is good considered we were getting full. The roasted baby carrots with hummus were decent too, yet the baklava was too sweet for my liking. The service felt rushed and pressured so I was surprised to see the default tip ratio on the POS set at 25/30/35% though our water was refilled fairly frequently.

I would say visiting once is likely sufficient as the overall experience is average and it’s not a loss if you’re unable to make it.",Chicago

Folks kindly had to move and let us in so we could sit at our reserved seats cause its set up family style. The food is great, its so good I'm going to try to remake the polenta cause it was unforgettable! I loved the wrapped dates, so savoury and rich in flavour. The staff were friendly, but abit overbearing in certain instances, coupled with the loud noise and lack of privacy due to the close seating arrangements, it can be unnerving.

ChIJNYrg38UsDogRP1lxJuC05hw,Kai DeBus,5,"Did you know that this Michelin guided restaurant has happy hour? It does! No reservations necessary. The chorizo, hummus, cod dip, and fresh bread were all affordable and delicious. Wine and cocktails are also offered at a reduced price. It’s a win-win!",Chicago
ChIJCQKeF7osDogRXujVV3cHa_Y,Virginia Brown,5,"Don’t skip out on this place, and definitely don’t skip out on the chicken.  Whoever is making the decisions back there is doing something very right.  The garlic mashed potatoes were immaculate—smooth, creamy, flavorful, and buttery.  The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection, with juices oozing out.  The flavor was spot on and the pan sauce complimented the chicken wonderfully.  Only thing is the broccoli rabe was incredibly bitter, nearly inedible, so I suggest swapping out that vegetable.  The tomato basil soup was to die for, and if you get the martini, ask for blue cheese olives, because those olives were amazing.  Seriously, this place is legit!  They even had gluten free pasta for my husband.  The chef back there KNOWS what they’re doing.  Incredible food.  And I’m definitely a food snob.  Bravo!",Chicago
ChIJCQKeF7osDogRXujVV3cHa_Y,Thomas Trala,5,"I went here for dinner twice while staying next door at the hotel. Both meals were excellent in terms of quality, portions and flavor.  I was staying at the hotel for the Chicago Marathon and having an Italian restaurant next door was just perfect! The staff was wonderful, making great small talk, learning more about me since I was visiting and giving great recommendations of things to do around the hotel area. They had a special ""carb load"" menu for the night before the Marathon which just showed me how much they cared about the visitors and what was needed. This will be my place to go whenever I come back for the marathon or any other activity in Chicago!",Chicago

ChIJCQKeF7osDogRXujVV3cHa_Y,Leo 263,3,"Server was amazing! He gave nice recommendations for drinks and food. Food was good. My only issue with the place was the rude greeting. The hostess or manager (not sure what her position is) was very rude. I entered the restaurant, there was no one at the host stand, I saw my friend seated and walked towards our table. I crossed paths with the hostess/manager and instead of saying hello or asking if she could assist, she spouted off a nasty comment. I felt attacked. Aside from her, my experience was a good one.",Chicago
ChIJCQKeF7osDogRXujVV3cHa_Y,Crystal Fields,5,Great experience. The staff was awesome. The atmosphere was perfect for date night before going to the theater. The food was exceptional. I definitely recommend pasta. It was light and delicious. Dessert stole the show.,Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Pooja Patel,4,"I’ve been to Quartinos a handful of times, and the food is always consistent - all the food is pretty good, but nothing special. The Penne Alla Vodka, Eggplant Parmigiana, and mushroom pizza are my go-to. This place is open pretty late, so it's an excellent place to eat post-games! I’ve been here for a few birthdays, and they can host large parties, which is nice!",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Vashti Faust,5,"We went to Quartino’s as a birthday dinner. I will admit, our experience didn’t start off great. We had an 8:30 reservation and had to wait about 35 minutes to get sat. We couldn’t sit outside due to a lack of servers I believe. Inside was very hot and loud, but that’s expected for an open kitchen layout on a Saturday night.

We got sat and could immediately notice our server, Julian I believe was his name, just got several tables all at once. The manager came over and was nice enough to get us started with drinks and explain the menu while we waited. We ordered a TON of half portions. It was so much food and every dish was better than the next. I highly recommend the slider, gnocchi, clams, and mussels.

Julian was absolutely fantastic. He made sure to constantly check up on us and even brought us over a little birthday sorbet (without singing thank god). Definitely will be requesting him out next time back in!",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Julie Dazzle,5,"This place surprised me!!! Amazing, good quality, family style Italian food! The place is very charming and the staff is very kind. They take true care of you when you’re there. Bread with Olive oil, Parmesan and balsamic to start and the food just got better with time. The food comes out as it’s made and it is all fresh ingredients and hot! Added bonus being the food being very affordable and generous portions- again family style. We ordered 3 dishes and a drink and payed around $50 for everything- TOGETHER! would highly recommend and will be going again on my next visit!!",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Sue Saarks,5,"Not pretentious at all.  Staff seem to like their job and enjoy the customers. Great food, awesome atmosphere.  Waiter was very helpful and kind. 💕  Highly recommend.

And the pizza is amazing.  Or so thinks my husband.

And the salad with goat cheese and shrimp was spectacular.  So tired of frozen rubbery shrimp.  This place actually serves fresh shrimp and a great salad.

We were 5 days new to Chicago. Glad we found it. This place will spoil you and other places will pale in comparison.",Chicago
ChIJqfIkY60sDogRMP2otSWdKJA,Lisa Whalen,5,"My husband and I traveled to Chicago for the holidays and decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. We are pasta lovers, so my husband booked a table at Quartino. The sign outside made it look a bit like a liquor store, and my eyebrow went up, wondering what the quality of food would be. The place is obviously popular, given that it was packed. They cram a ton of seating in the space, which made it challenging to get around, but curiously, it didn't detract from the experience. It was a well controlled hustle and bustle, like a large family trying to gather everyone together. Abbie was our server, and she seemed knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the food. She was very friendly and took the time to chat with us despite being busy with several tables. The portions were just right, which I appreciated because many Italian places in my experience sacrifice quality for a humongous plate of mediocre food. We started with the polenta fries, mortedello with pistachios, and gorgonzola. The meat and cheese came with candied fruit and an apricot spread, which were delicious. Our entrees were a bolognese and an Australian strip streak with broccolini. The steak was a perfect medium. The pasta was light, airy, and came with just enough sauce. Everything was super fresh and looked good enough to eat. We should have shared a dessert, but as usual, our eyes overruled our stomachs. I thoroughly enjoyed a coppa alla banana, and my husband devoured the hot chocolate cake. Either of these was enough for two people to share without a fight ensuing. We would definitely recommend Quartino and will likely be back for another visit.",Chicago
ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,Hifsah Ahmed,5,"If you’re looking for an upscale restaurant to come with coworkers after work, celebrating a big occasion, hosting an event, or simply catching up with friends, I believe Roanoke is the spot for you!

The list of food we ordered include: French Alexander, Boss Lady, Buffalo Cauliflower, Roasted Salmon, 14oz NY Strip Steak and ended with Chocolate Lava Cake! I can say everything was absolutely wonderful but the Buffalo Cauliflower was the best part of the dinner for us. I’ve tried this dish in other restaurants and it never tasted exactly like chicken wings, but this did! I was amazed!

The service was terrific! We had Leo as our server and he did a fantastic job helping us decide, giving us suggestions, making great pairing choices. I highly recommend asking for him if you could!

The ambiance and atmosphere gives you upscale and bougie. You could pass wearing something casual but you’ll fit right in wearing formal wear. There were people of all ages and occupations, and the dark vibes, and fireplace interior made everything perfection.

10/10 I’d come back again!",Chicago
ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,David Lee,4,"Pretty good food in a moderately upscale looking restaurant in the downtown of Chicago. There are tables and booths but might be good for smaller groups (8 or less). There’s some steaks, seafoods, plenty of sides and delicious sweet desserts.

Food
I came with my coworkers for a team dinner so I had the chance to try a variety of sides along with the seabass I ordered for myself. First off, the fish was pretty good and the meat was soft and not dry. Bones were not a concern and overall enjoyed the dish.
The burrata was excellent and trying the jam over the bread is a must.
The fava bean hummus appetizer was good as well and is something to get if you like hummus.
The meat and cheese board is nice to pick at but nothing too exceptional about it.
We got the hearth oven mushrooms but that wasn’t very popular at the table and we ended up not finishing it.
The brussel sprouts were well cooked and pretty good.
For dessert we had the panna cotta and the apple cobbler and I thought that they were both very good. The panna cotta flavors can be different depending on the season.

Atmosphere
The interior looks upscale and is very organized and clean. I did find the tables to be a little low though. The noise level was not too loud for on a Thursday evening and I could hear people across the table. Good place to come celebrate or just have a nice dinner.

Pricing
The prices are average for this type of upscale restaurant, but a little bit more expensive if you had chosen to get these foods at a more casual place. The price was worth the food.

Service
I have mixed things to say about the service. We had made a reservation for our group of 10 people but when we arrived they had tried to seat us at 2 separate tables for our team dinner. We didn’t request this but then eventually they were able to accommodate us and seat us all together. Otherwise, the service was good and taken care of promptly.

ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,Valshae Alt,4,Most of my food was warm except for the tomatoes for some reason. The food arrived quickly. A cozy place that fits lots of people,Chicago
ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,Amanda,2,"Literally awful! The main restaurant looked so fun and pretty and lively. We made a reservation but were sent up a narrow staircase to what is basically a hotel lobby. Dark, bland, and uninviting. Sat next to a dark room and a table full of kids who ran around and were loud and disruptive. Our waiter was MIA 90% of the time. Our food came out cold. I got the Buffalo cauliflower and it was super cold and soggy - I mean COLD, and unappetizing. I wanted it to be reheated, but again, our waiter was nowhere to be found. By the time I was able to ask for it to be heated up, everyone else was about done eating. Our drinks remained empty and our water, gone. Literally couldn’t get WATER. Come on. Only thing I enjoyed were the biscuits. Would not recommend AT ALL.",Chicago
ChIJAdXyvrssDogRfPeijP0aa1k,Steve H,5,"Excellent burger and fries.

I took my business colleagues from out of town here for lunch and everyone thought the food was really good.  I had the burger and fries and my colleagues had a fried chicken sandwich and a reuben sandwich and all were good.

The ambiance and style of the restaurant is dark and cozy and seems like it would be a good place to take someone for a few cocktails.",Chicago
ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Nicholas P,5,"No reservations. First come first serve. When we came we were seated right away by the kitchen. Does it live up to the hype and is it the best burger I ever had in my life? No not really because I’ve had a lot of burgers in my life. It is however a really great burger and I would get it again if I was in the area. Prices are fair because quality was great.

-Double cheeseburger with bacon and egg 5/5
-crispy fries 5/5",Chicago
ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Peter Farejowicz,5,"Au Cheval is another Chicago icon slinging out it’s popular gourmet burgers and fries. Been meaning to try this place for so long and finally had a chance to visit.

I ordered the go to of many people which is the single cheeseburger but added the egg and bacon on top. Don’t be confused, the single is actually a double and the double is actually a triple so plan accordingly. The meat was well prepared but the extras of egg and bacon really made the burger. The bacon was thick cut and seasoned perfectly. Everything melted in your mouth. I’d definitely eat this burger again but be aware, it is pricey so it’s definitely a splurge compared to something like In-n-Out which tastes equally as delicious.

Service was fantastic. Our waiter was great and even brought us an order of fries with egg and sauces on the house that we didn’t order so I was impressed.",Chicago
ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Alicia Llorens,5,"This was the best diner experience I’ve ever had in America. Elevated diner food with no fuss, amazing taste and even better service. The rim on the Bloody Mary with dry garlic is to die for! The burger is juicy, tasty, super soft but firm bun, the bacon is just extraordinary and the egg was cooked to perfection. I was so full but couldn’t stop eating the hash brown… like, amazing. And dessert was just gluttony but absolutely worth it. I ended up sharing with someone sitting next to me and our server Spencer said it was on the house! Like, 10/10 experience!

The only but is the line system at the entrance door is a bit confusing and everyone is jamming at the entrance which I found a bit overwhelming.",Chicago
ChIJ78NyRsUsDogR6AqyYoPrts4,Prateek Madhikar,5,"Wow, incredible food. The burger, the bone marrow, the bacon, the fried chicken, and the dessert were all 10/10 for me. I'm normally quite critical about the food I pay for and I would 1000% come back here for these items.

Come here, it's more than worth it.

Only thing I'd change is the volume of the music as it's a bit too loud 😬",Chicago

My friend and I arrived at the restaurant 1 minute before it opened and there were half packed. We got a table under window. We had a very good experience. Burger and fries were really outstanding! The staff's service and their attentiveness also made the experience great. Highly recommend eating here! Loved my meal here and will happily return.

Had no idea we were going to be treated to such a great meal, service, and atmosphere. Friendly staff that know how to read a table. The staff exuded pride in the establishment and their work.

The building is stunning and the decor is rich and warm. The heated patio was perfect for brunch. Location is absolutely prime!

I ordered medium-rare steak with my brunch which did come out a bit too medium for my preference. I do not mention this as a complaint... more of a tip for you rare steak lovers out there! It remained tender and juicy and I enjoyed it despite the temperature.

We recommend the Duck Poutine. 👌 👍 Fantastic coffee.",Chicago

My wife has a salt issue and cannot have cannot have much salt as it is a medical issue. It's always a challenge to find a restaurant who can accommodate her.  The restaurant was fully packed Saturday night during taste of Chicago.  You could tell they were struggling as they probably didn't plan on having a full house as they did.

Lisa's fish came out with salt accidentally.  Michael didn't hesitate to make things right and really impressed us. It was our first time here we will definitely come back.

ChIJReajl7EsDogRe-JWhrT51uw,Andrew Thornton,4,"Had a really great lunch at Siena Tavern last week.

Food was mostly winner after winner. I started with the Octopus which is maybe the best dish I had on my trip. At least up there. Stunning to eat and to look at.

My wife had the coccoli which were beautiful. Hard to go wrong with prosciutto.

I followed that with the gnocchi which was awesome. My wife had the mushroom and truffle pizza which was also great.

The one big let down were the bomboloni for dessert. Super dense and just not great. I mean, they're fine. It's fried dough, it's going to be fine, but we were not impressed. Of the sauces that came with it only the caramel was great though my wife liked the chocolate more than I did.

Drinks were excellent. My #4 was a winner and my wife loved her espresso martini.

Decor was great. Service a bit weird. Very friendly and helpful but not overly present including when drinks got low. Also started out by asking about our familiarity with Top Chef and if we knew who Fabio was. When we said we did we got a bit of a spiel about his time on the show and how great he is.

Which was weird, especially when we'd just said we knew. We watch the show. Knowing him is part of why we were there, and it was near our hotel and made a convenient lunch. I don't mind it being acknowledged, but the little spiel felt awkward. Not a huge deal. It didn't go on that long or anything, but an awkward start to the visit.",Chicago

Every member of the team was incredible - friendly, helpful, flexible and extremely professionally. The entire booking process with our requests and changes took nearly a month and was executed perfectly from start to finish.

Judie went above and beyond to help us with the challenging arrangements posed by our organization. She was patient and thorough. We took up so much of her time and had some unconventional payment requests but she helped us work through them. She dealt with many iterations of changes and even helped us with the flowers at the last minute and they were perfect. There are too many details to cover but let me say, she left no detail unattended! We must’ve had over 30 phone calls! She was truly outstanding and we could not have done it without her.

Also a shout out to Sarah for being open, flexible and so professional. She helped with a lot of the behind the scenes requests and also made sure the evening was smooth for us.

Please also thank our servers. They were both swift and attentive.

The food and drinks were great too! This place is perfect for a business team dinner but equally enjoyable with friends and family.

It definitely gets crowded, and you might have to sit at the bar, but any spot in the house is worth it. I enjoyed watching activity in the kitchen.

The fritters were great start with a pesto aioli that was whipped into an almost cloud like texture. The tortellini had an exceptional texture with a nice balance of spice and savory flavors. Squid ink risotto was another beautiful dish with complex flavors.

Rose Mary lived up to the hype and I would say we will be back again soon, but that would require there to ever been an open reservation (4.7/5)",Chicago

But the old Italian Village design remains the same and unmatched for its wonderful history. The lasagna, pasta, veal Marsala are all still delicious. It’s more casual than it used to be but service was excellent and portions huge.  After all these years it’s still a great place.",Chicago
ChIJ40jWaNAtDogRe5p7qLoxrRs,Gamer James,5,Had a nice lunch with my friend. The lady at the reception was super friendly. I am not used to italian food she took her time to explain us the menu. The food ambience was awesome. We had pizza and it was top notch.,Chicago
ChIJ40jWaNAtDogRe5p7qLoxrRs,Justin L. Williamson,3,"This is a fair place to go if you want some Italian food. While I ordered Root Beer and some weird, light liquid that tasted nothing like root beer came out, the food was pretty good, and the bread was amazing.",Chicago
ChIJ00KvtLwsDogR3GNih9CYiQs,Joseph Powell,5,Very good authentic style German food. The pork was great. It had a nice smoked flavor and the sausage was bold. The Wiener schnitzel was good as well with a buttery finish. The interior of the place had a very timely and old world feel to it. The different beers from the attached brewery are worth trying in one of their four beer flights.,Chicago
ChIJ00KvtLwsDogR3GNih9CYiQs,Anastasia,5,"I went to Chicago in April and I still think about that food sometimes. It is peak comfort food. Wraps you like a warm blanket after a cold rain. The food is what I imagine a grandma would cook (I don’t have a German grandma but I picture her cuisine just like that). I had most awesome soup, great cocktail and just enjoyed every bite. This doesn’t happen too often to me  but I  just fell in love with that place. Would want to go back to Chicago just to go there again.",Chicago
ChIJ00KvtLwsDogR3GNih9CYiQs,Dave W,5,Great place!  Authentic German food. Super cool atmosphere and history.  The entire Staff was exceptional.    Restaurant was clean and has so much history to it.  Def recommend it was phenomenal!!  Def recommend getting reservations as well it was packed when we arrived and when we left luckily we had reservations.   Great spot!!!,Chicago
ChIJ00KvtLwsDogR3GNih9CYiQs,William Duffel,5,Great dinner. First course was the bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp. Awesome. Great cocktails. Bread order came with 3 breads and a giant cheese crisp. I had the beef medallions rare with fingerling roast potatoes and grilled asparagus. Very good. Service was great and would definitely come back. Highly recommend. Beef was a tad chewy at rare temp. Probably grilled teres major medallions. Would eat again probably mid rare next time. My waiter was Christopher J and he did a great job.,Chicago
ChIJ00KvtLwsDogR3GNih9CYiQs,Bryan Riley,5,Such a unique restaurant with great story. We absolutely loved everything the ordered. My wife couldn't get over how moist the black forest cake was. My schnitzel was SO good and my son just loved the chicken soup. We all can't wait to come back to Chicago to come back to Berghoffs!!!,Chicago
ChIJHy_uxjQtDogREgbDgcjizn8,Irene Rico,5,"This is always my go to! Was there for my birthday. From the moment you step into the elevator the fragrance is so inviting! Everything is always great! Our server Luce was amazing, attentive,  has a great smile and personality! The drinks are all made with fresh juices which is a must in my opinion. The food is absolutely delicious. Fresh and so good. Love the atmosphere with all the natural light and music is top notch! Total vibe. You will absolutely be seeing us very soon! If you haven’t been you must.",Chicago
ChIJHy_uxjQtDogREgbDgcjizn8,Gene Ivanov,5,"Step into Aba, a delightful Mediterranean haven in Chicago's lively Fulton District.

ChIJHy_uxjQtDogREgbDgcjizn8,Claudia E,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. We first visited when they first opened back in 2018 and now again in 2023 (we are not from Chicago). The food tastes incredible. We got the classic hummus, crispy potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and chicken kebab plate. The house bread is addicting and you will probably be asking your server for more. The only thing we did notice is that the service is slow. It took a very long time for everything to come out but considering it was delicious we overlooked the long wait. Will definitely be returning on my next trip to Chicago.",Chicago
ChIJHy_uxjQtDogREgbDgcjizn8,Suhail Peer,5,"Aba is one of my favorite and personally highest rated restaurant ever! The service is amazing, the food is just mouthwatering, smells amazing, and delicious. The drinks are a nice pairing to their shared platesu. The indoor dining room is lively while the outdoor patio is bright and lush. I’ve dined both inside and outside.

Their brunch menu is also very good — to be honest without drinks their brunch is very affordable!",Chicago
ChIJHy_uxjQtDogREgbDgcjizn8,Brandon Douglas,5,"Rarely do I just hand out perfect 5's. Aba is definitely an exception to this as they go above and beyond to make sure you have the best culinary experience they can achieve. The food is amazing quality, and everything I've tried so far has been extremely well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The cocktail, wine, and specialty beer selection have so many choices for any meal pairing occasion, and the service makes you feel like you're right at home with some of the most professional waiters/waitresses and Chefs in the business.  We need more restaurants like this in the city.",Chicago
ChIJtydKsawsDogRY5t2aUIXeBc,Keith Housholder,5,"The 676 Restaurant & Bar is an upscale breakfast venue. My wife had the house-smoked salmon and I had the prosciutto Benedict. Both were delicious. The venue was classy and beautiful, if that's not redundant. The service was Michelin level. I highly recommend this restaurant.",Chicago
ChIJtydKsawsDogRY5t2aUIXeBc,Kevin O'Brien,4,"We went here based on Google ratings, and the restaurant was surprisingly empty. The service was fantastic and the food was really good. The only downside to this restaurant is that the ambience is a little dated. It feels like an old restaurant that needs a facelift. Otherwise, I would definitely go back for the food. The price was reasonable as well.",Chicago
ChIJtydKsawsDogRY5t2aUIXeBc,Jade Chandler-Haag,5,"We ordered the 676 Burger, Chicken Calzone, and Pepperoni Pizza. Everything was delicious and the crust on the pizza and calzone was crispy, chewy, flavorful goodness. Our server Dena really made our experience 20/10! She was personable, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Our drinks were never empty and the food arrived quickly. I definately suggest dinner at 676 Restaurant & Bar!",Chicago
ChIJtydKsawsDogRY5t2aUIXeBc,Brie B,1,Can’t review the food because we were never seated but can comment on the service. Visiting from the west coast and made a reservation we were excited about after reading these other reviews. We waited about 10 minutes at the hostess stand on what looked like a slow night. We asked the bartender if we would be helped after no one acknowledged us and he said someone would be right over. Waited another 10 minutes and decided to leave. Had a great dinner at Quartino close by!,Chicago
ChIJtydKsawsDogRY5t2aUIXeBc,Sarah Rhodes,5,"Amazing food, great service!!! Very reasonable priced gourmet food. My steak was seriously amazing!! Top notch, melt in your mouth. Our waiter Victor was so sweet. Very kind and friendly. The food came out so quickly. & I would eat here all the time. Small menu but good choices and very visibly pleasing with great flavor.",Chicago
ChIJcVWnFFPTD4gR4wHd5_rdgxo,Jared Tidwell,5,"Top notch service and atmosphere, if you are okay with a packed, nostalgic styled establishment. Food is good but expensive, which is relative to your budget. $200+ for two at dinner. I’ve always enjoyed the sides and the desserts but not wowed by the main courses. It’s a must when in Chicago, despite some of the issues which are subjective.",Chicago
ChIJcVWnFFPTD4gR4wHd5_rdgxo,PL,5,Classy restaurant setting.  Excellent food and service.  We had the calamari and crab cake for the starters.  The RL burger and the corned beef sandwich for the main meal.  All fantastic.,Chicago
ChIJcVWnFFPTD4gR4wHd5_rdgxo,Anthony R,5,"What a beautiful atmosphere at the RL Restaurant. I had a light lunch at the bar and had a wonderful experience even though this place was jam-packed during my time there. The service at the bar was amazing, and the food was solid even though the menu is somewhat limited. I couldn't recommend the Polo Bar highly enough. This establishment is extremely classy!",Chicago
ChIJcVWnFFPTD4gR4wHd5_rdgxo,Andrew,5,Absolutely one of our most favorites in Chicago.  Ricardo was a fantastic server.  Atmosphere is classic and warm feeling.  Food is spectacular!,Chicago

ChIJ-XdXNKUsDogRW-m5g5Siao8,Jerry’s Adventure,4,"Great brunch location with fast service and quality food.
Wagyu sandwich was delicious, tender beef, and solid seasoning.
Brussels sprouts, however, were bit oily due to excess oil and choice of cheese, I would not recommend if you seek something light for your side dish.
Macaroni and cheese was on point with balanced seasoning and with good textures.
Chicken wings were a great appetizer. It’s slightly on the sweet side but the hot sauce makes the flavor perfectly balanced. Super crispy shell and tender, fall-of-the-bone meat were the highlights.
Our server was attentive.",Chicago
ChIJ-XdXNKUsDogRW-m5g5Siao8,Preston p,3,"An hour wait on a Saturday at 2pm is a bit much especially when the restaurant wasn't that busy but hey. This location definitely takes advantage of it's prime spot so close to Nederlander theatre, Block 37, Daley Plaza and the like. We liked the food but spending 206 bucks is a bit much for a Saturday late lunch. The menu is very heavy drink filled and there aren't that many food options. Greg the manager was great and very friendly. 9 dollars for a hot chocolate with one housemade marshmallow was a bit much. We also got charged a tip already for a bit party even though we just had 6 of us. It's a shame since we probably would have tipped more than they put on there. We enjoyed our time here but won't be back due to the long wait times, expensive food and lack of food options on the menu.",Chicago
ChIJ-XdXNKUsDogRW-m5g5Siao8,Josh Banfield,5,"Old school Chicago restaurant with a large selection of American food and great cocktail options served by workers in classic Chicago style.

We came for lunch and it was packed, so I'd recommend making a reservation vs walking in. The buffalo chicken sandwich and the BLT were amazing, the portions and side of fries were huge and one easily would feed two people.

They also have good bourbon drinks, bartenders are not rookies by any means.

Coming for brunch or dinner are both great as the menu fits either need, can't wait to come back for the burger. At least 10 came out of the kitchen as we were there.",Chicago
ChIJ-XdXNKUsDogRW-m5g5Siao8,Mitch Stewart,5,"Came for lunch, got seated right away in the bar area and really enjoyed our experience. Our server, Ting, was very attentive, and we ordered the everything Parkerhouse rolls, and the beat Bobby Flay fish and chips. Both of them came out piping hot and fresh. They make the rolls to order and Really are perfection!",Chicago
ChIJ-XdXNKUsDogRW-m5g5Siao8,Melina Hopkins,4,"This place was good but didn't really live up to the hype. It was loud, service was meh and the food was good but also super heavy. The ice creams were okay but there is an apple dutch ice cream and pie plate advertised and not served. This was a bummer because it was part of the reason we went there. Our serverwas pretty hard pressing us for drinks. I'm not sure if it's because we were sat at the tables by the bar but that wasn't our choice. We had a reservation for 6pm, arrived timely and sat around 6:20pm. Our food came out pretty quickly and we were able to make it to our show on time.",Chicago
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Kevin K. Francis,5,"We had a party of six and when our entire party arrived, we were seated promptly. The food was excellent and the entrees included appetizers. We were there during happy hour which we all would highly recommend! The only reason I rated the atmosphere with 4 stars was due to the problems the staff had with the thermostat. Although the manager addressed it, it was a little uncomfortable during our dining experience. We were encouraged to put our phones in a little box in the middle of the table to help us enjoy each other and not social media. It was a nice touch! The bill came in a locker which was different but we found it to be a cool conclusion to our evening.",Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Orane Williams,5,Celebrated my father's birthday. Prior I was in communication with the events team for my reservation. The communication was great and any questions and concerns I had was addressed. Day of the event although the Host team didn't have my group in the computer my table was prepared prior. My server introduced himself to me and went through things. My family enjoyed the food and service we received. My father enjoyed his birthday dinner with his family at this restaurant. The team presented him with a personalized complimentary bottle of wine to commemorate his birthday.,Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Morgan Ackley,5,"Alex is a fantastic server. Very attentive to fill up cava and water as needed. He informed us of daily specials and lunch recommendations. The food was very fresh, all produce, fish, croquettes, salads etc  seemed extremely fresh and locally sourced. The presentation and plating is also impressive for the price point (which felt very accessible for the area). On top of that, the outdoor patio offers breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay. Thank you, Alex!",Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,Mason Thornburg,4,We really enjoyed the experience and the food was great. I can't leave a 5 star because the attention to details was not there. It was my wife's birthday and I spoke to them prior to our visit and wanted the cake to come out and say happy birthday on the plate. I spoke to them while we were there about the cake and told them who she was at the table. The cake came out and no happy birthday written on it. Kinda ruined the moment. Other than that the place was great. I attached a pic of the cake after we started eating it.,Miami
ChIJ56WSjYG22YgRV8CLvPG3z9E,A. Love,5,"The food, atmosphere, ambiance, and service were right on point. They seated our large group in the back, which was great. We were able to walk in and out to take pictures for my friends birthday, but try locked it once we began to eat so other customers would not continue to use the door to enter and exit. It's an all-around great restaurant to experience.",Miami
ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,Alex Parker,5,"Amazing experience and memories. This was our first stop in Miami, dinner celebration for our anniversary. We had a table by the water to enjoy the amazing skyline.

Victor was our server and was so amazing. He had amazing rapport with everyone and was very attentive.

We tried several items, chicken, filet, NY strip, salmon, Calamari, and our favorite by a mile, Sticky Toffee Pudding. The chefs left us a signed note for our anniversary, which was a nice tough.

The ambiance was perfect and we are very happy to have made this our dinner. 10/10 would come back.",Miami
ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,M Velez,5,Had a wonderful Thanksgiving brunch.. our waitress Cynthia was AMAZING. She walked us through every step of the menu with many recommendations.

ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,Brian Seymour,5,We visited for our anniversary and were not disappointed. Our waitress Valentina was wonderful. We followed all of her recommendations. We started with the grilled octopus. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Risotto and my wife had the grouper. The meal ended with a chocolate lava cake that was divine.  The meal and drinks were pricey but worth the atmosphere and quality with such an amazing view of Miami.,Miami
ChIJc2PcMM612YgR_kdEdDDuTrQ,Julie Moran,5,"First of all the views are out of this world! The food was also fresh, inventive and very delicious. Melissa was a wonderful server.

ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Robert Hill Jr.,5,"Beautiful restaurant. My wife and I’ve been wanting to go for a while, and this was our first outing after our son was born. Rain falling in the covered patio made for a wonderful ambience. Food was delicious, not managed to take photo of tres leches after halfway done. It was one of the best Caesar salads I’ve ever had, not just because of the shrimp I added. Would highly recommend.",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Ismonde Guillaume,4,"Chica Miami was nice. I love the earthly colors and the paintings and plants. It took a while for the food to come out, but the food was pretty good. I saw the section for the live band, but they were not there when we were there. A little background music would have helped pass the time. As we waited for our food, my friends and I took some pictures. I rate it 4/5. I would like to go back and see the live band and entertainment",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Cecily B,5,"Came to CHICA for a birthday brunch and we were all blown away. Our server was Jenn and she was AMAZING.

Thank you Jenn! We will be back soon 100%",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Nicole Martinez,4,"This was our first time brunching here. We came for a birthday with a group of 12 and we were accommodated easily with a reservation. The ambiance and decor is nice.

Sunday they had bottomless mimosas for $36 per person. The food was delicious, but some of the plates were small.

The Paisa Breakfast Bowl specifically was amazing, I forgot to take a picture of it, but for $25 I was hoping it would be a shareable size. I would still buy it again.

The timing of the plates was a bit off - the first plate came before the drinks and then they all came together but took some time.

They included the Pistachio Cinnamon Rolls and a round of shots for free since we were celebrating  a birthday. Sky was our waitress and she was very nice and attentive.

I’ve also been here for a date night and for dinner and I loved their unique menu, this spot is awesome and I definitely recommend it!",Miami
ChIJy6YGjsiz2YgRqWTIgzZD-bc,Sule Quintana Rangel,5,"Excellent food!! Incredible service with attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable staff. The drinks were tasty but soft.

✅ Food was SPECTACULAR, from the appetizers to dessert. Garlic in other places usually got me in trouble after eat, but that wasn’t the case here.

⭐️ Great presentation and outstanding service. Yeilan, our waiter was beyond attentive and helpful. No waiting time. Super chic deco, comfortable space.

🚨 The happy hour area was noisy but they have a quiet area with a different atmosphere, more tranquil.

🧁 Oh and that dessert was really something else!!

💰 We spent $195 (No drinks) They offer a parking discount too 🚙

Another sneaky pic of my bf enjoying his lamb.",Miami
ChIJKc4o84ux2YgRwV9hXejE_6w,Ilona Nesterova (ILONA_TRAVELONA),4,"It had good service but very empty. And boring. I wish more people would know how tasty scallops are there.
Drinks are interesting too. Portions so you never get full. Pricing is a bit high knowing how much competition is around.
It was nice but I would not come back on a Friday night there to feel like I’m 100 years old. Must do some vibe.
Tartar was a size of my nipple. Very small portions really.",Miami
ChIJKc4o84ux2YgRwV9hXejE_6w,Christine Cross,5,"Relaxed atmosphere, very comfortable! The food was delicious and you can tell there was a lot of thought out into the presentations of all the dishes.

ChIJKc4o84ux2YgRwV9hXejE_6w,Tad Kpandja,5,"Boulud Sud Miami is a Mediterranean restaurant located in the JW Marriott Marquis Miami. I believe it's a sister restaurant to Boulud Sud in NYC.

The restaurant has a stylish, yet relaxed atmosphere. The dining room is decorated in jewel tones and soft fabrics, and there is a large bar area that is perfect for cocktails and people-watching.

I did not try the food at Boulud Sud Miami however, rhe menu features a wide variety of dishes. Some of the highlights include the grilled octopus, the roasted branzino, and the lamb shank.  During my stay, Boulud Sud Miami was hosting wine tasting event.

The service at Boulud Sud Miami is also excellent. The staff is friendly and attentive, and professional and friendly.

Overall, Boulud Sud Miami is a wonderful dining experience. The food looks delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is stylish and relaxed. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal in Miami.  The only con is the Boulud Sud Miami can be pricey.",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Josh Friedlander,5,"Exceptional food. The oysters are a
Religious experience. The paella is very good. The pan con tomate is worth the carbs. The chocolate ganache dessert will end you. For the quality of the food, the prices are reasonable. I recommend you eat here while you can get a table.",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Laurence Mercier-Lafond,5,"Just WOW! Will definitely be back soon! We were lucky enough to get seated early on a Thursday night without a reservation.  My boyfriend said he’d come back here for their bavette steak rather than go to a steakhouse, it was THAT good! He even ate the artichoke which is a miracle! Everything was delicious. We also enjoyed the Arroz Sec, Tomato Bread, and Mahon + Chorizo. The skin contact wine Mission was funky & delicious. Service & ambiance were super pleasant",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Juan B,5,"Delicious small spanish bites paired with wine or beer (no hard alcohol). We loved the asparagus (my fave), shrimp, branzino tartare, octopus leg, tomato bread and the olive oil cake! Great spot to share plates with friends",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Hully Rolemberg,5,"One of the best spots I’ve ever been in Miami. Sophisticated food, good wine list, cozy environment. The dishes were absolutely delicious. This is definitely not a typical Miamian place, and that’s the good thing about it.",Miami
ChIJZaayip622YgREjbxQzuRm7Q,Holmes Beltran,5,"Finally made it here after a long time wanting to come.
This place is so easy to miss when you're driving or even walking so thank god for Yelp these holes in the wall are found. I also found an article on the Miami New Times about the owner and Chef and was surprised that this is Spanish food, Catalán to be specific but more of a playful take on it, says the article.
I came here to try the infamous Today's Rice dish which is Chef inspired and therefore changes daily.
Today's it was made with clams and it did not disappoint at all. The dish is basically a rice with the delicious broth and whatever seafood protein they add that day. Rice is cooked perfectly, with kind of a risotto consistency and it comes in a metal pot. I just couldn't get enough of it because it was that delicious and the clams were very flavorful and most importantly, fresh. Although the dish looks small when you first see it, it's not small at all. Next time I'd love to try the Ous, a popular item on the menu that also sound delicious. For dessert that had this chocolate ganache topped with small pieces of bread, like croutons almost, that had olive oil so it was sweet and salty with some crunchiness to it, really good.
The service was as good as I expected it to be and the owner was very attentive as well as the waiter. I can't wait to try the rice with scallops they had last week and definitely the Ous. The joint is very small so I don't recommend large groups, keep it small.",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Sleepy (Sleepy),5,"Incredible experience. Went to try the Miami Spice menu on a Sunday night with a friend visiting from out of town. Would recommend going at this time, as there was hardly anyone present, if you're looking for a more low-key evening.

The food was absolutely stupendous! Absolutely nothing bad to say about a single one of the dishes. This place has one of the best steaks I have ever had at a restaurant. With the current Miami Spice deals it's an absolutely uncontested champion of value for what you get from it.",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Tommy Thang,5,"During our recent stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Miami, we had the opportunity to dine at Toro Toro on a Saturday night, and it was a pleasant experience.

Our evening began in the comfortable lounge area, where we enjoyed a couple of cocktails while watching a college SEC game on a large screen. The combination of sports, bar ambiance, great food, and attentive service made for an enjoyable start.

Our server from the lounge also provided excellent service at our dining table. She was knowledgeable about the menu and even brought the head chef to our table for an introduction and to explain some of the dishes.

We started our dinner with prawns, octopus, and pork belly, which were all satisfying. However, the highlights were the perfectly cooked filet mignon and the flavorful red snapper, along with a great wine list offering many worldwide options. We ordered a bottle of Medalla Malbec from Argentina, which had a very nice bouquet, medium to full body, dark ruby red color, low tannin, and a slightly dry finish.

Our side dishes, including broccolini and lobster mac and cheese (amazing), were also well-prepared and delicious. The dessert options, such as flan, key lime pie, and various cakes, were tempting for those with room for dessert.

The overall dining experience at Toro Toro was fantastic, with our high-top dining table and big screen TV adding to the ambiance, especially with the great service and tasty food. We would definitely consider returning on our next trip to Miami.",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,M,4,"The drinks were amazing, bar tender was very attentive, remembered names and made great suggestions for folks.

I had crispy prawns, lobster mac and cheese and corn empanadas and they were all fire. Definitely on the more expensive end but nice for a fancy date night or a classy family celebration.",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Rachel Alexis,4,"Yahaira was AMAZING! She recommended the skewer and BOY was she right. I tried the lamb for the first time…YUM! Lobster Mac and cheese? YESSIR! The MASHED POTATOES!? Heaven. I do not like the broccolini/asparagus though, undercooked and rough. Everything else, including Yahsira’s service, was PHENOMENAL. It’s worth eating here to try out! Unique good, unique drinks, great experience! Make sure you leave room in your pocket (pricey, but high quality).",Miami
ChIJl1O4GSe02YgRLccjkiMlp5Y,Holmes Beltran,5,"Another amazing dinner date with friends for the first time at this joint. Im going to skip the drinks not because they weren't good but because the food is just amazing here. To start the apps are so delicious and l'Il tell you which ones we liked the most so let me break it down for you....
The lomo saltado empanadas: tender and juicy beef tenderloin with avocado and soy sauce, melted mozzarella. The beef was so flavorful that I almost ordered seconds and everything just melted in my mouth. I guarantee you that when you try these you'd want to place an extra order, that good.
Chicharrón de camarones: crispy shrimp, aji Amarillo, avocado and rocoto mint salsa. This tastes almost like a sweet and sour shrimp but crispy.
Shrimp perfectly cooked and the crust was just amazing.
Chaufa: one of the best chaufa(fried rice) to date.
Rice cooked to perfection with chorizo and chicken and good portion.
Grilled Octopus: I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that this is the best grilled octopus I've ever tasted. Tender to the core while charred on the outside and sitting on an amazing sauce, this is by far the best grilled octopus in town. It comes with a side of potato salad that is good but unnecessary if you ask me because this octopus needs nothing on the side.
Chicken and chorizo croquettes: my wife absolutely enjoyed these croquettes so much she almost didn't share lol.
Cheese board: five different cheeses including goat and mamchego with honey and fig jam.
Skirt steak: medium well cooked perfectly and tender topped with plum, string potatoes and a delicious salsa verde.

Mac and cheese: surprisingly a really delicious Mac and cheese at a Peruvian joint is shocking.
La Bomba dessert: amazing presentation and very yummy. Chocolate sphere with berries, Dulce de Leche and strawberry ice cream, almond cookie crumbs, cheese mouse, vanilla and berry sauce all collapsed on the table over a plastic cover and big enough to share between four people.
Cortadito cheesecake: least favorite and really nothing special.
Having broken down the dishes I have to say that the service was top notch and possibly exceptional compared to other places we've been to. Our waitress was most attentive, friendly, helpful and interactive.
Going for the parrillada type dish for two people next time we come here.",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Megan Roloson,5,"We picked this place to eat just by its name and were not disappointed. The outside seating is amazing by day and magical at night. Service was a tad slow, but given the overall food and experience, I can't complain. That said, I wasn't a fan of the world's best chocolate cake, but when in Rome. There was also someone walking around and taking your photo. Then then offered them to you in a frame for $20. Normally, I am not into  being solicited at dinner, but she was very respectful and low-key about it. The photo looked great, so we ended up buying one. Overall, 9/10 from me, I would not recommend taking kids there, though.",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Melissa Munilla (Meli),5,"I’ve been here before for brunch but finally tried out dinner. Everything was DELICIOUS. I had the Luxury Paradise Martini to drink & every entree comes with a free appetizer. I went with the Ox-Tail Tacos & the Wagyu Steak with truffle mashed potatoes. Dessert was not that memorable for me. Our server, Anastasia, was very friendly, understanding & patient. Totally recommend this place for its service, ambiance & food 🤍",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Tiff_ Eatz,5,"First time visiting Dolores But You Can Call Me Lolita, not from the area and the whole experience here was elite. The rooftop area is absolutely beautiful, the music, the decor, absolutely perfect. The food is delicious, the menu style has a bit of everything you’d want for brunch and then some extras that are attractive, like their desserts. The service is top tier! We had a slight issue that cause us to be delayed with our arrival and they were more than accommodating and one other suggestion, is to add non dairy for coffees, they stated only dairy is used. For us coffee lovers. Greatly appreciate that and our waitress, Ana, was great! Very kind and provided great service, thank you for making this visit extra great!",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,Aimee Albright,5,"I absolutely LOVE the vibe of this place. It’s very cute & lush! The food was delicious - I had the Poke Bowl & it was surprisingly big. The Lobster Quesadilla was AMAZING & the corn bread was really great as well. The service was also exceptional, and Oscar was great! I definitely recommend checking it out!!",Miami
ChIJ9aBMC4S22YgRbGgugfhBkbA,GV G,5,"Held a private dinner event here and the service was top notch. And the food!? It was delicious! Their cornbread was sooooo good and some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, delish!

Would totally recommend this restaurant.",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Lisette Ferras,5,"I had an absolutely delightful lunch experience at Sexy Fish! From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the restaurant's modern and stylish ambiance, which perfectly complemented the ocean-inspired theme. Each dish was a masterpiece, showcasing the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The chef's creativity was on full display, with innovative flavor combinations that tantalized my taste buds. Even the presentation of the dishes was a work of art, almost too beautiful to eat!",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Arlene Rios,5,We went for my daughter’s 20th birthday! We were in awe of the place from the moment we walked in. The staff was very welcoming and our server Francisco was on point. The food was exceptional! Presentation is everything. From the appetizers to the drinks to the food and even dessert was amazing!! It was a lovely experience.,Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Patty Vazquez,3,"It is no secret people come here for the ambiance. I found the food to be okay. I liked my 2 appetizers a lot, and my corn fried rice just tasted like rice. I had 2 drinks as well - I am used to paying the prices of the drinks, but was somewhat shocked at the size for the price. However, I will say drinks were delicious.",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Sidhdesh Halde,5,"Always wanted to dine here, and see what’s all the hype about. decided to surprise my wife with dinner reservations at 6:00 pm, we got there at 5:45 and were seated right away. We were only given a wine list, and a few minutes later, the familiar stopped and asked us if you want to start with wine or cocktails, after saying, we want to start with cocktails he gave us a different menu and asked our water choices. I got the sparkling water my wife just got a tapwater, and then we were greeted by our server who took our drink orders. We got two appetizers, two drinks and a dinner to share amongst us and a kimchi fried rice. The appetizers were really good and so was the dinner. The manager stopped by a couple times to ask if everything was good with our food and drinks and decided to order another cocktail which was really good. It was a really nice experience and finally got to check out the bathrooms which will make you think that you are under the water. I’m giving this a five star as a service was top notch and we felt special when we were there. Definitely recommend this place to try something out of the box. The menu prices are on the higher side but I think it was worth it. we also tried their chocolate lava cake and it was the best ones I had in a while.",Miami
ChIJdfkR4PC32YgRgxEP4swq1oY,Erin Pinotti,5,"Our server was Alonzo, and we went for the set lunch menu on a Saturday.

The service was excellent, Alonzo was knowledgeable about the menu, very friendly and attentive. The Drinks were always full, and we didn’t have any long waiting periods between courses.

The food was fresh, perfect temperature and good size portions. We saw some comments that people were disappointed with the small portions, but I disagree, they are all normal sized.

The building itself is beautifully decorated with lots of interesting art pieces. Definitely recommend going to check out the bathrooms for the mosaic pieces.

10/10",Miami
ChIJlz72E5622YgRLXWCKTEFM_M,Dien Diep,4,"The service is great. Very attentive staff. It was a cozy atmosphere. More for adults than kids. The seafood appetizer was amazing. It was their special. The seafood risotto was so good too. The short ribs were okay. It needed something for freshness. It felt like a heavy flavored dish but lacked depth of flavor.  It is a little pricey here, but the portions are good. What we ordered would have fed 4 people. If you like seafood, it's worth a try. Definitely would come back if we are in the area again to try something new.",Miami
ChIJlz72E5622YgRLXWCKTEFM_M,Lyle Bridges,5,"OMG This place is awesome, from the ambiance to the service everything is completely on point. We will definitely be back! Make sure you ask for Lorenzo. Each item we had was distinct in it own way. We did appetizer, drinks, main course, & dessert. Fabulous, would recommend to anyone.",Miami
ChIJlz72E5622YgRLXWCKTEFM_M,Amanda Casey,5,"Such a beautiful place. The food was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Our waitress was beyond fantastic, best service I’ve ever received from Tesla.

Thank you Tesla",Miami
ChIJlz72E5622YgRLXWCKTEFM_M,Alex Ford,5,"Wonderful food and ambiance! I was dining alone and decided to sit at the bar, and boy was I glad I did. The bartender was wonderful! He made many great food and drink recommendations and I loved everything I tried. I'm not often in Miami, but I will definitely come here again when I can.",Miami
ChIJlz72E5622YgRLXWCKTEFM_M,Zahraa D,5,"Absolutely exceptional! One of the best restaurants we’ve ever been to. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is very knowledgeable of the food. All we had to do is let the server know what we liked and he got us exactly that!
We got a plate from the “Hot Kitchen” all kinds of seafood grilled to perfection. The spices were so good, outstanding. I personally got the Acevichado sushi roll and it was delicious, sweet and savory all in one. First time trying this sushi style. The Peruvian ships were so good and the sauces too.
It’s a high end restaurant, very classy, and beautiful environment. Highly recommend!
Will be coming back on my next vacation.",Miami
ChIJibzB0aK22YgRA7qS7Tfh4_Q,Juan Pedro Asencio Flores,5,"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit! The cuisine is fantastic and the ambiance is cozy and inviting. The decor and atmosphere are both top-notch, and the servers are incredibly friendly and welcoming. You won't be disappointed with your experience here!",Miami
ChIJibzB0aK22YgRA7qS7Tfh4_Q,Bianca,5,"A simple date night. My partner and I wanted to try this restaurant out together and our experience was worth it. From the service (Thank you Henry and the chef team) to the food and drinks, we were not disappointed. I had the Guyanese oxtails, while my partner had the Fried yard bird as a main dish. They were delicious. The oxtail was well seasoned and the flavor of the sauce was amazing. However, I did not like the texture of the rice, so I just ate the oxtail alone. My partner enjoyed the fried yard bird. We also tried the Mac and cheese as well as the cornbread. I would definitely visit again and recommend it to others.",Miami
ChIJibzB0aK22YgRA7qS7Tfh4_Q,"Troy Bishop, P.E.",5,"The food and environment is really amazing and something to experience if you're in Miami. We had the deviled eggs which had a great mustard flavor, and the jalapeno butter served with the cornbread was perfect. The kale salad was nice and delicate and we paired that with the cheese grits and the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was different, more tomato and andoiulle sausage-based than the classic white gravy, and I thought it was fantastic. The interior decorations are so beautiful it feels like you are inside some kind of historic moment and indeed you are, since the Chef has won so many awards relating to his food and his serving of communities. They only hire staff from the community as well, so the whole place gives such a homely vibe in combination with the soul food inspired dishes. Will definitely come back.",Miami
ChIJibzB0aK22YgRA7qS7Tfh4_Q,Jessica Miles,5,Had a wonderful lunch here! Jessica B (Yésica) as our server. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. We LOVED the cornbread. The jalapeño butter was amazing! And the Overtown Bacon Cheeseburger was just as delicious! The pictures don’t do the place justice. Would definitely return!,Miami
ChIJibzB0aK22YgRA7qS7Tfh4_Q,Victoria Elena Valimbri Acosta,5,"Delicious food, beautiful interior design and great service. We were waited by Carlos, he speaks incredible Spanish and gave us amazing recommendations. This has definitely become one of my favorite restaurants in Miami.",Miami
ChIJKVAQIZ222YgRxqIAgjmhNz8,Zinga Hart,5,"This place provides the old school luxury charm of a steak house. Absolutely beautiful decor if you enjoy the heavy quite feel of the classic NY steakhouses.  I had the sea bass and it was well cooked and a healthy service. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were filling sides. The lamb was great but could have used a sauce. The rib eye was well done but could have used a bit more seasoning. Overall be ready to drop some funds but the food, atmosphere,  and service makes it worth it.",Miami
ChIJKVAQIZ222YgRxqIAgjmhNz8,Misha C,5,"This location superbly upholds the standards of the Capital Grille brand.  Andrea took amazing care of us, she was attentive, timely, friendly, and helped us with any questions we had about the menu. The interior is very classy, lots of cozy booths, interesting artwork, makes you feel pretty fancy. We had the burrata, the Neuske bacon with KBBQ rub, the lobster tail, and the gorgonzola encrusted NY strip. Everything was delicious, the steak was cooked to perfection, and my friend devoured his lobster. The bacon was addicting. Come hungry! I liked that we never felt rushed, we could take time in between courses. We were too full for dessert but I bet they are all good. Ask your server for the dessert drinks menu too! Cognac, whiskies, cordials are available. Wine by the glass for as low as $11, as someone coming from NY this is an amazing value for such a wonderful steak house. Thanks again to Andrea for making our night feel so special!",Miami
ChIJKVAQIZ222YgRxqIAgjmhNz8,Coach Pat,5,"Great fancy restaurant. Food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  We went for a end of school year celebration and had a great time. It is in a great location at Brickell.  They have valet service, but it us a little confusing cause of the lack of signs (it looks like a construction area which causes the confusion). You must enter the garage to get to valet area. Great atmosphere for the entire family.",Miami
ChIJKVAQIZ222YgRxqIAgjmhNz8,Steve,5,"My wife and I made reservations for the Capital Grille. We arrived a few minutes early and were given a nice table immediately. Joe was our waiter and greeted us with a big smile. He was extremely knowledgeable and suggested their signature drink a “Stoli Doli” which is my new favorite drink. Joe also suggested the shrimp cocktail; I was amazed at the size of the shrimp and how fresh it tasted. The cocktail sauce had the perfect amount of horseradish for a nice kick. We also ordered the burrata and heirloom tomatoes. I ordered the Filet Mignon and my wife ordered the Sea Bass. We also requested the potatoes au gratin. My steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare and the sea bass was also perfect. The potatoes were hot and creamy: excellent! I’m a dessert guy so I asked for the Capital Grille cheesecake, and it was scrumptious! Joe was  “nonpareil”- “outstanding” ! He came back to check on us regularly and was so friendly. I left Joe a GREAT tip and he earned every penny of it. When you get great food and great service, make sure you leave an outstanding tip!",Miami
ChIJKVAQIZ222YgRxqIAgjmhNz8,Jonathan Shaw,5,"Whatever your dinner plans are, cancel them if you haven't been to The Capital Grille yet!

The steak alone makes the visit worth it. And yes, the steaks are absolutely worth the price. You'll be very hard pressed to find better!

In addition to the flawless steaks, the staff are impeccably professional and engaging.

Margarete Selva was our server, and her warmth and attentiveness made the night that much better. She perfectly balanced professional knowledge, recommendations of dishes, and pleasant demeanor!

I'm definitely coming back. You should too!",Miami
ChIJCe1Siqi22YgRIlkVdQQCv6g,Sara Uhlig Perez,5,"Amazing Friday dinner experience. The food was so good, and I loved the menu variety. Our server was so nice and funny, and gave really good recommendations. His timing was perfect all night. We loved chatting with him.  (I wish I could remember his name 😩 I just remember that he was from Algeria!) The oyster selection was great, we enjoyed all of them and the variety. The wine I chose was super yummy, and the desserts were insanely good. We couldn’t decide between two desserts, so they brought us the second one we didn’t select on the house, along with a candle in the other for my birthday. Big thanks to our server and the lovely hostess who helped make my birthday so special! We can’t wait to come back.",Miami
ChIJCe1Siqi22YgRIlkVdQQCv6g,EA Simoneaux,5,"Our first Miami Spice restaurant! $60 for an app, entree, and dessert. This restaurant reminds me of New Orleans. The decoration is minimalist with a New Orleans flair and it is well done! I felt relaxed here. The music was great…Haitian jazz to beasty boys..super fun. Our server, Lester, shared the menu with us, asked if anyone had allergies or questions. He gave us the perfect amount of time to look at the menu and we never felt rushed. The crispy black fish with lump crab, olives and beans was soooo good. They were very generous with the lump crab meat and I really appreciated that! The fish and sauce with a nice roux type gravy..was not overly salty. I loved that none of the dishes felt overly salty. Another thing I found super interesting were the sides they offered. The sides offered with the entrees are unique and not the standard steamed veggie or fried potatoes. The pairings are unique and if you didn’t want them, you can actually request to change out your sides to some on the actual sides menu. I thought that was a nice touch and something you don’t see very often. Feedback on the desert is that the bread pudding flavor has depth and layers of flavor but I found it to be incredibly sweet. Tone down the sweetness a little, and it would be perfect. As a New Orleans native, I was impressed with their Cajun influences. Sitting across from the cemetery, I felt just like I was at home in NOLA. 😂

I can’t wait to come back and try gumbo one night. Lester told me the roux is brown so you know that’s a good sign!

Mignonette, I am so excited to get some New Orleans seafood in Miami. Our family will certainly be back!",Miami
ChIJCe1Siqi22YgRIlkVdQQCv6g,Annie Klian,5,"Great Miami Spice deal - you can pick the appetizer and entree from the main menu. The food was excellent. I had octopus as appetizer, 2 lobster tails with sweet potato wedges & polenta sides, and the bread pudding. Tried my friend's appetizer which was the diver scallop. All was excellent. Great service as well.",Miami
ChIJCe1Siqi22YgRIlkVdQQCv6g,Samantha C.,5,"We visited for Miami Spice and had a wonderful experience! Our server, Luis, was patient with us not knowing what to order and made great recommendations. We opted for a bottle of wine, which is definitely worth it instead of paying for individual glasses. The chargrilled oysters are divine as well as the lobster deviled eggs. The red fish is delicious, though the rice was a bit soggy for my liking. Finally, the butterscotch bread pudding is amazing! Come with an appetite, you will not be disappointed.",Miami
ChIJCe1Siqi22YgRIlkVdQQCv6g,L Wilson,4,"The fried oysters were seasoned so well!! They were delicious! The lobster was good, but I wish it was served warmer. The cheesecake was decent.

ChIJte0b2xux2YgRr8f-xaLb0jw,Marjorie Munson,5,Literally unbelievable good. The beef tartare was the best I’ve ever had and is mouth watering good. The pastas are amazing and the caviar potato skins were so insanely yummy and so fun. Vibe is so cool too. This is our new favorite spot.,Miami
ChIJte0b2xux2YgRr8f-xaLb0jw,Elisa Romulo,5,"Such a hidden gem! I loved the character of this restaurant, hole in the wall, unusual, but lovely. I enjoyed seating at the bar and enjoy my food with some amazing wine. I appreciate the sommelier tasting each wine before actually serving it to ensure quality. Also the willingness of the staff to accommodate us even without reservations. Last but not least, the food quality was superb. The sizes were perfect and the food was shareable. Everything was absolutely delicious.",Miami
ChIJte0b2xux2YgRr8f-xaLb0jw,JEREMY RIDGE,5,"One of the best restaurants in Miami. A hidden gem that usually requires a reservation to dine. It’s small and a relaxed vibe. The chopped salad and the lamb ribs were my favorite. Every employee there seems happy and made sure my experience was above par. I think 4 different people checked on my party and they made sure I was happy. The chefs spoke to me and asked feedback which I thought was refreshing. Also, this establishment has earned a Michelin Star! The ingredients were hi-quality and fresh and the service was fantastic. This is a place where you can relax and have those fun and meaningful conversations. I can tell why this establishment earned that Michelin Star!",Miami
ChIJte0b2xux2YgRr8f-xaLb0jw,Netali,5,"fantastic. the service, food & environment were top notch. they listen & go above and beyond with hospitality.
my personal favorites were the steak tartar, sunchoke pasta & tiramisu. (do not skip on these!!) the salad that everyone raves about is just a regular salad in my opinion.

cant wait to come back & also try their sister restaurant walrus rodeo!

thank you for an incredible dinner experience",Miami
ChIJte0b2xux2YgRr8f-xaLb0jw,Connie Lee,4,"Lovely speakeasy vibes, felt like I was in Brooklyn! Nice splurge on great food, although I went home pretty thirsty, maybe too much salt. $1/table charged for Vero water (totally unnecessary and wasn't advised prior), and 2% healthcare charge which is stated on the menu. Would come back with girlfriends for sure!",Miami
ChIJ-0J6oCi32YgRhhxfaT9WcvQ,John Martinez,5,"What a great experience! live music from a DJ, music is very vibrant. I was in the second floor and the ambience was calm nice view.

ChIJ-0J6oCi32YgRhhxfaT9WcvQ,Jasmine Houston,5,"This place was AMAZING! It’s quaint, it’s sophisticated and it’s very warm and welcoming. This place is great if you’re a local or a tourist. The staff caters to everyone so pleasantly and the host, Daniela was so sweet and so professional. The food is very fresh and cocktails are unique and delicious. I went here for a self care day during Happy Hour and loved it so much I booked a second reservation during the same day just to go back with a friend of mine after she got off of work. The listening bar is definitely a unique experience making it the perfect place for a date, catching with friends, a coworker or even spending a nice evening to yourself. This place is a must try if you’re in Miami and definitely worth the drive if you live outside of Brickell. Honestly if I could rate this place higher than 5 stars I definitely would! (Side note: I’ve spent this year traveling to different countries and even attended NYFW but out of every place I’ve gone to, this is by far the best bar I’ve been too all year)",Miami

ChIJH1SfSSix2YgRw06Dht3Qsnc,Michelle B,4,"MAU Miami was a nice vibe, the staff was super friendly, vibrant and energetic. The location is a mid high end area, parking is free but hard too find unless you pay $21 for valet. The food I believe could have been better. This particular day I believe the kitchen was having a hard time however, that’s still unacceptable. The French Toast was very dry and the chicken with our waffles was certainly over cooked. The shrimps and grits was good, the colossal shrimps was decent. Me and my friends wasn’t impressed. I would try them one more time but the dinner menu possibly. Hopefully this was just a bad day.

I did enjoy seeing the birthday celebrations while visiting. They have a nice routine for birthday celebrations.",Miami

I’ve always seen this place when I go to Midtown, so I’m glad I had the opportunity to try them out. When we walked in, all of the staff from the hosts, waiters, and bartenders were very kind, accommodating, and fun. We had an entire side of the restaurant just for the event. The bartenders were extremely friendly, and made the best drinks I’ve ever had thus far. Especially the lychee Mojito, which was a perfect blend of sweetness and mint. The waiters were very accommodating and kept the food coming out nice and hot. I really loved the shrimp, tempura sushi, and fried rice that was served. The sushi was packed with shrimp, and the fried rice had a nice flavor and presentation to it. This restaurant is the perfect blend of a lounge and a restaurant so you get wonderful food plus a nice upbeat ambiance to have fun as well. I definitely would like to come back to Mau Miami  to try their weekend brunch/lunch menu.",Miami

We did the Miami Spice with the wine pairing.  Lamb Shank was delicious! Everything was outstanding!

This hidden place was incredible the vibe and the atmosphere is so romantic. I would take anyone on a first second or hundredth date to this spot. It is very beautiful the lighting decor and everything screams unique and romantic.

The mini lights on every table is so cute and the seating outside which is where most of the guest seat is breathtaking with the fresh breeze…Superbe.

Service : A1! We had amazing service from Marco. He was super attentive to everything we did! If we had half our glass filled,he would direct the waitress to come refill our glasses. They sat us down very quickly let us pick which table we wanted. It’s a beautiful place and we enjoyed our time spent coming here on a romantic dinner date

The food: was absolutely extraordinarily perfect just wished there was more on the plate.

We had a nice red wine paired with Lamb my favourite was the : roasted cauliflower.
It was so delicious. I decided without hesitation to order a second order. I loved the spinach gazpacho and feta mousse with the roasted Cauli. It paired beautifully together. It was cooked to perfection shoutout to the chef juste delicious wow

Then we had the chineese eggplant. It was delicious also paired with some gazpacho spinach ricotta mousse unfortunately it was not enough we wished there was more we devoured the dish in 2 minutes.

We shared the lamb chops dish extremely tender fall off the bone and very well seasoned with lots of flavour the cook was perfection again!

We also had some duck prosciutto it was amazing but again portions were limited wish it was thicker cuts of the amazing prosciutto and the lamb chops were minute as well.
But the cook is/was: Perfection ! Every single bite we took kept us wanting more and more it was irresistible. The plates were all cleaned up in minutes!

For dessert, we had coffee to settle all what we devoured down .. maybe we will try the desserts on our next trip definitely count us in! we will be back here for sure ! 10000% recommend

Cheers!",Miami
ChIJZ6H_apy22YgRhi7477auRg0,TJS,4,"There are very few restaurants in Miami that consistently provide good food at a fair price with good service - which is why my go-to list of dining establishments is quite limited in Miami compared to other cities.  There’s always something missing at most Miami venues.

However, Alloy Bistro checks all the boxes - after at least 5 visits over the past 2 years I’ve been impressed by their food, service, and value (especially for Miami, which has become insanely expensive)

The ambience is surprisingly cute considering it’s not the best part of town, coupled with the somewhat unsettling maze of hallways you need to traverse to find it.

I’ve always opted for the lush outdoor dining area, as the inside is quite small and  narrow.

Family owned and operated, you can tell the food is made with love and they genuinely care about your business.

I will be back again - something I can’t say often in Miami.",Miami
ChIJOVl231mx2YgR7HvVdFmsUuc,Shiva,5,"If you want to sit outdoors in the yard make sure you make reservations. The food was great and the restaurant very clean. It had a very pleasant and good vibe. Staff are polite and know about the menu and can give recommendations. We got what they recommended and were happy with our food.
The house bread with their olive oil was heavenly!
Also there’s only 2 gender neutral restrooms inside so there were lineups at a time.",Miami
ChIJOVl231mx2YgR7HvVdFmsUuc,Jay Nolasco,5,"Niche restaurant with a nice energy. Greek and Turkish samplers were terrific. I loved the hummus and olives. The bread and pita paired nicely. The lamb was really good. It was cooked well with plenty of flavor. The chicken kabob was juicy with a smoky flavor(really good). I loved the rice. The beef was a little dry, but the grilled vegetables were delicious. Service was lacking, though.",Miami
ChIJOVl231mx2YgR7HvVdFmsUuc,Kristofh Pozo,3,"The place is nice to enjoy a daylight lunch with healthy and fresh ingredients. Strongly recommend to book a reservation specially during lunch hours. The host at the entrance is not too friendly. We also had a little issue, they served a plate it wasn’t part of our order and requested to be switch it to the right plate, it took 55min to be served so we canceled it at the end. The waitress also overfilled the glass of water by accident and we had a little mess in the table to dry out. Not a big deal but worth to mention. Overall delicious food. The service needs to improve.",Miami
ChIJOVl231mx2YgR7HvVdFmsUuc,Sofia De la Mora,5,"Lovely Greek restaurant! Went with a large group of friends and ordered to share which was perfect. We were able to try a bunch of appetizers - we loved the baked feta and Greek Meze sampler. For entrees, we got the mussels and the whole fish which is a must! Service was a bit slow but very friendly, seems like they were understaffed. Ambience is chilled, great for groups and families. Prices are on the higher end. Would definitely recommend!",Miami
ChIJOVl231mx2YgR7HvVdFmsUuc,Margaret,5,"This place is must for Miami, make a reservation before hand! The whole restaurant is outside which in July was a bit hot, but manageable.

The google reviews is what brought us there and even with a 4.9 rating, I wasn't expecting such great service and perfect food for everything we ordered. We were served by Franco. He asked us what type of food, flavours and textures we like, we told him to bring us what he thinks would give us the best experience and he delivered 1000%. He made our experience unbelievable! He really knows what he's talking about and I couldn't recommend this place enough, everything was PERFECT. If you're hesitating, just go and you won't regret it.",Miami

The dessert to die for … the Dulce de lech very soft and unique , the merengue very fresh and over all the pavlova was a hit. Our sever Javier was the best very detailed oriented and explained and recommended the best dishes.

The hostess was great, and she was kind and informed that she could get us an outside table. The food was beautiful and delicious, and the service was impeccable. It was a crowded day, so needless to say... Make reservations. Please don't risk it to be on the safe side.

We got to take part in the Chef’s Counter experience which was a 7 course meal curated to a max group of 6 people. The food was amazing and each dish was presented to us by the chef who made it.

Special shoutouts to Wednesday & Andrew for their excellent service.

Things I enjoy eating.

The crab cake hush puppies.
The swordfish.
The deviled eggs.
Shoot. Everything I’ve had so far has been delicious and devoured.

If you are looking for a nice, quiet but lively brunch spot with a lot of visual appeal I would definitely suggest this place.",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Mariana Mercado,5,"Service is wow!!! From the waitress to the servers everyone is so attentive and nice. We started off with a peach salad, a very unique taste so it is a must try! Also the ravioli a very unique taste with corn filled and pepitas, had never had anything like that before. The fried eggplant was delicious!! Not a fan of eggplant but the crisp and sauce gave it an extra twist! I had the pork (since I don’t eat seafood) and it was very flavorful! My husband had the fish and oysters (the ones from Canada which are more salty where his favorite)! Definitely a must try if you are in Houston! Forgot to mention the dessert! The best dessert I have had in HOUSTON!!!",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Jiah Park,5,"My son liked bolognese pasta. It wasn't salty and the sauce was really deep. It's not in the picture, but the grilled octopus was delicious and the oysters were fresh. Don't miss pecan ice cream for dessert.",Houston
ChIJJ0aTHObAQIYRPKlKBtryX9Y,Moon Morales,5,"So this place never disappoints and we’ve been coming over a year and it’s one of my top 3 restaurants in Houston! My favorite thing is the attention to detail when it comes to the marriage of ingredients to make some of the most amazing tasting dishes. The chef has carefully placed a unique spin to some of the classic home cooked dishes while respecting and honoring the culture and roots of each dish. After having the cheesy grits I said the chef must be from Alabama because that first bite took me back when I ate some cheesy grits in Alabama. The ambiance is classy, southern and cozy and you are always greeted like family and on your way out a delightful ginger Whoopi pie is offered for Free!!! Who does that in Houston???  Manager George is so personable and the entire staff is awesome!!",Houston

The hostess was polite and efficient, the manager who returned our Landry's card was polite and professional, and our server Roberto was outstanding!

ChIJ1_fBKTG_QIYRWdRY0QE5LH0,Liza Gultom,4,"My husband brought me here to celebrate my bday,so far I like the place as well my little girl, because she can see the big giant aquarium with a lot of fish in it 😉.
The food and drink came on time. The only thing is my husband order his food and to tell the waiter to  make it spicy and the waiter ask if it’s okay to give jalapeño and we said Yes.the food came we did not see the jalapeño and ask our waiter and it took a long time to bring it out.
And after we finished the dinner, the waiter also forgot to brought the complimentary cupcake for us. So we have to remind again to bring it. And during to pay the bill they charge us for extra $ for something we did not order.
My suggestion to all Check your bill before you pay.",Houston

The atmosphere and menus are pretty similar but I’d say Hillstone has slightly less options. The food was just as to be expected delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. All the food we got was perfect and I only wish we had more. One thing to note is this restaurant has a pretty strict attire and cell phone policy - while my pictures were fine, any phone calls had to be taken at the front.",Houston

I can't comprehend how people are so miserable at work, He was wondering the table next to us I would hate to think he was rasists he was extremely friendly and happy with the people he was serving next to us, I will return because I love the food here but felt very uncomfortable because him on a better note our waitress was great..",Houston

I wasn't happy since that wasn't what I was aiming for on a date night, a TV in the background. The food menu is limited but the steak and risotto were both well done. The bartender made the night enjoyable, extremely attentive. We got lucky it was practically empty. On a busy night, I'm sure he wouldn't be able to attend to us as much. Overall if you're looking for a decent place to eat before a night on the town, this is it. If you're looking for upscale date night, this isn't.",Houston

Our waiter was slow but I didn’t mind too much because I like to enjoy my meal with feeling like I’m being rushed. The food was good. I had the salmon and really enjoyed it, my friend got the shrimp and grits, the shrimp was wrapped in bacon can’t go wrong there but the grits weren’t as creamy as she likes them to be, and my other friend had the lamb chops no complaints there. Everything had a lil kick to it but not too much. The cream brûlée was really good (one of the best I’ve had) and the bread pudding wasn’t bad either. I like the portion size not too little and not too much. The menu is fairly priced. I can’t wait to try them for brunch.",Houston

The food had pepper everywhere. My little salad on my plate had so much pepper in it that it wasn't edible.  I ordered a side of 4 shrimp for $12. I didn't mind the price. I just thought they were going to be a nice size they were not, and they also had a lot of pepper on them. The chedder biscuits were hard, and not like a biscuit at all, we had to leave that behind.

ChIJ7zHRFyS_QIYRpBj5GnuFAno,Ralph turloff,2,"$292 before tip for two steaks a salad a soup and a $50 bottle of wine.

Nothing included with the steak have to pay $8-$20 for something on your steak as well as $12-$25 for a side.  ( we had beans and cream potatoes that were both under cooked.

Our waiter kept coming back to the table every 30 seconds. Think he wanted us in and out in 20 min. If I’m
Going to spend that kind of money I want to sit back relax enjoy myself and not be rushed. The wine server had no idea what grape variety the wine I asked about. He had to go get the bottle to find out. Then when he opened the bottle he put the cap
back on the bottle like it was a bottle of coke cola.

Unless I had a company credit card there’s no way I would spend my own money at this place again. I’ve had better $25 steaks that have come with sides and sauce elsewhere.

This is one of the finest, if not the finest, restaurants in the Denver area. My family and I were blessed at first by having the distinct pleasure of being serviced by our waiter, Bryan. He made our dining experience an excellent one by being very attentive, proactive, passionate about the menu/food, ensuring we had a five star dining experience and shared his personal journey and story in the hospitality industry. Later our table was greeted by Arthur the manager. Now I must say he sets the example of what an exemplary manager both is and should be!! He took time to come and introduce himself, spend time and converse, laugh and share some of his humor. He then wished my dad a happy birthday and I thought that was the end of it. Well, after we had been served our meal, about 15 minutes later and much to my surprise, he personally delivered me one of the best cuts of tomahawk steak as a personal birthday gift to my dad from him! We were so overwhelmed we could barely contain ourselves. Then we had a personal visit from the Executive Chef himself, Steven Garza. He wished my dad a happy birthday, conversed with us, showed profound interest, and took a picture with my dad and wished us a pleasant dining experience. So with a grateful heart, my family and I can truly say God blessed us during our fining experience with fine food, passionate people and the spirit of grace and love during our visit! 10/10!!!",Houston

ChIJm9BVXCG_QIYRIiu1vr-o29I,Stephanie Willis,5,"Loved the atmosphere and the ambiance were awesome. I loved the round tables which facilitated conversation and everyone could see and hear everyone else at the table. Lots of oldies were played (Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, etc) which went along with the overall theme of the restaurant. Our server, Charnae, was attentive and awesome. She checked on us frequently and made sure we were comfortable and our needs were met. The general manager was very professional and gave us the history of the restaurant’s food. If you want to experience authentic southern cuisine, this is definitely a spot that delivers.",Houston
ChIJm9BVXCG_QIYRIiu1vr-o29I,shanique Adams,5,"Beautiful ambiance. It's so nicely decorated and exudes the definition of Kulture.......with the different art and furniture. Our waiter, Que was very knowledgeable about the menu and different happenings in the city. The bar has a huge selection and let's get to the food ......... that oxtail shepherds pie 😋 and those saucy ribs are definitely worth a second visit!!!",Houston
ChIJm9BVXCG_QIYRIiu1vr-o29I,Dr. Katina Harris,5,"We made a reservation and bought a table for two for the live entertainment. We were a little disappointed with the food options. After seeing past reviews, we anticipated more variety. However, I was pleased with the vegetarian option. I ordered cauliflower steak and fries. Hubby ordered the club sandwich. The wine was good. The entertainment was good. We enjoyed the atmosphere. If you want drinks & music, this is definitely your spot. Patience was essential as it was a busy night. Overall we enjoyed the experience.",Houston
ChIJm9BVXCG_QIYRIiu1vr-o29I,Jonathan Oetken,5,"Was really good. Just expect to pay a premium due to location. Also, reservations book up fast and quite ahead of time so don’t just show up on a whim. The only open seating is the bar and I think there’s only 8-9 chairs. Shrimp & Gouda grits were absolute fire. Wife let me have some of her toast and butter and that sweet butter was ridiculous. I like mixing many juices in my mimosas and he was nice enough to accommodate my desire by providing OJ, pineapple and cran. Good experience for sure.",Houston
ChIJm9BVXCG_QIYRIiu1vr-o29I,Kim Reynolds,5,"Amazing food! We started with the Creole Mussels. We each tried a different dish and shared. I had the Oxtail Shepherd's Pie, a coworker had the Ravioli, and another had the fish of the day with risotto. Then we tried both desserts. Food wash fresh, perfect portion sizes, and we left fully satisfied but not stuffed. Service was also wonderful. Definitely recommend",Houston
ChIJ325pwi-_QIYRtB5lEbq1nCI,Karina Nistal,3,"We came as a group of six on our ladies night. The food was good but the service was just okay. I'm not sure if our server was flustered or what was going on but something seemed off. I arrived a little late to our table and wasn't greeted or asked my drink order until he came back. I ordered the Avocado salad with chicken and a gumbo. It was steak night so a few of the girls opted for that and we got two appetizers. One of the girls got served a much smaller steak with two sides she didn't order so we sent it back. The manager (or someone- a lady) was nice enough to come apologize to the table for our friend's delay on her food. At the end when we received our check, we all tried to divide the check evenly with the scan code on the receipt but it wasn't working. There was an error message we all kept getting so we asked our server to divide the checks. He said he didn't think he could do that but one of the ladies told him he needed to do that because there were no other options. Somehow between the tax and 20% tip it ended up being $60 each. A little steep for a drink, a salad and a cup of gumbo but we decided to just pay and call it a night. The service was not worth 20% but I suppose a group of six makes it automatic. The ambience was really nice and we had great company being together but I'm not sure if we'll be back.",Houston
ChIJ325pwi-_QIYRtB5lEbq1nCI,Jay Norflett,5,"Simple and delicious brunch menu, tasty drinks, nice ambiance and we had a great server named Arlene. Price is super reasonable. Without drinks you can eat for like $14-$18 a person. I literally cleaned my plate and have zero complaints. Now the playlist is a little spicy and the rnb is uncensored. So listen at your own risk. Will 1000% come back. Super pleased. I got the prosciutto omelet and my friend got the chicken and waffles. Both plates cleaned and scraped.",Houston
ChIJ325pwi-_QIYRtB5lEbq1nCI,Mariana Valverde,4,Went a Sunday evening for Houston restaurant week. Lady that took us to our table didn’t seem very friendly but our server was great. Took a longer time than what it usual to get our orders in but the food was delicious except for the salmon entree that lacked flavor. The cream brûlée and the meatballs were the best. The restaurant wasn’t as cool as I hoped since I was walking around downtown so it took me a while to cool down. But overall I would go again.,Houston
ChIJ325pwi-_QIYRtB5lEbq1nCI,Lashonda Ward,4,"OVERALL: What an amazing experience. It has a local vibe, with a quaint ambiance.

PROS:

ChIJ_S0zYo3BQIYRsN3bE-GqWCI,Soni Joao,5,"Excellent restaurant. Amazing food. Great ambiance. 5 star service. Food varies from seafood platters, caviar, soups, steak, burgers, salads, plenty appetizer options and so much more. Fresh fish. Great flavors. They make very good mixed drinks (their old fashioned and martinis are excellent). They also have an impressive wine menu. Perfect for date night, dinner with friends business dining or any occasion.  Highly recommend.",Houston
ChIJ_S0zYo3BQIYRsN3bE-GqWCI,Pam Wang,5,"Every one is welcoming. Food is very palatable. A great dining experience from beginning to the end. Thanks to our waiter, Bryan, who made excellent choices on behalf of us. Highly appreciated!",Houston
ChIJ_S0zYo3BQIYRsN3bE-GqWCI,HighLine Executives,5,Lupe and Juan gave us a 5 star service. GOT US HYPED for the Astros game! Definitely value customer service here,Houston
ChIJ_S0zYo3BQIYRsN3bE-GqWCI,Deidra Lashmet,5,What a great space!  Very traditional fine dining.  Service is excellent!  Enjoyed the Christmas lunch offering.  Sea Bass with caviar sauce was cooked perfectly.   The touch of goat cheese and cranberry to the Butternut Squash soup wasa delight.   I don't typically drink gin but the Gin Fizz was a delight!  Space is beautiful designed for that cozy comfort vibe.,Houston
ChIJ_S0zYo3BQIYRsN3bE-GqWCI,Kaleena Burns,4,"Incredible atmosphere, attentive service, moderate food. We celebrated a birthday here and the intimate atmosphere is what drew us in. We loved the rich details, club chair comfort style seating, live piano/singing, 12/10! Unlike many other reviewers, we received top notch service. We dined on a Thursday evening and were sat immediately. Incredibly attentive and knowledgeable staff. Mgmt stopped by a couple times to ensure we were satisfied, 12/10. Where Turner’s fell short is the menu. Here’s what we ordered:

Fried quail - well seasoned and deep fried. Liked the sausage gravy, but didn’t impress.
Wagyu filet - petite, lacking in flavor. Had better filets at Eddie V’s. Potato bake with Mayo based topping was quite good.
Tomato soup - bland, not impressed.
Skirt steak - flavorful and tender.
Tetrazzini - disappointed we spent $32 on this. Pass.
Coconut cake - wonderful! Highly recommend!
Bread - the complimentary bread is what we keep talking about long after dinner. Great pretzel bread, we’d go back just for the bread. We should be saying this about the other menu items.",Houston
ChIJWZy-UJnAQIYRJwZNRAGa6JI,Alan Ritchie,4,"The food at Hugos is phenomenal. Each item tasted very authentic and fresh. I highly recommend going during the happy hour as you can get great deals on drinks, appetizers, and tacos. During non happy hour, the food is pretty expensive and may not be worth it to some even though the flavor is great. Although the food was exceptional, I feel like the atmosphere could have been a bit better. It was nice inside but for the price point, I feel that it could have been nicer. Overall, if food is your main concern, definitely come here. If the atmosphere is most important, you may want to go other places.

Note- they have valet parking.",Houston
ChIJWZy-UJnAQIYRJwZNRAGa6JI,Mariana Mercado,5,"I had the angus beef with mole and bean tamale and it was very delicious! The tamale was so good! The mole sauce was also great, the steak could have a little improvement (was not as tender) but other than that would highly recommend this plate! My husband had the duck mole and it was falling off the bone, so tender! The churros were crispy and flavorful, would have them again! Definitely a must try restaurant in Houston",Houston
ChIJWZy-UJnAQIYRJwZNRAGa6JI,adela santos,5,Wonderful experience. Beautiful restraunt and great staff. Our waitress went out of her way to help us find something my autistic toddler would eat. Our food was so good and the drinks were yummy. Will go again.,Houston
ChIJWZy-UJnAQIYRJwZNRAGa6JI,Chuy Quezada,5,First time coming to Hugo’s and it was a great experience. Drinks were in point. Food was delicious and service excellent. It turned into one of my favorite restaurants around Houston area …,Houston
ChIJWZy-UJnAQIYRJwZNRAGa6JI,Leminal,5,"Authentic Mexican food done beautifully. We didn’t have a reservation but were very lucky to be seated inside the main dining room. The decor was bright, open, elevated and classy. We also notice how we both liked their their dinnerware, cocktail glass, and dinner table that we almost want to get the same glass for ourselves.
For appetizers, we ordered Brussels sprout, ceviche, and suckling pig. The pork was so juicy and tasty, paired beautifully with corn tortilla that we devoured everything. For mains, we had carnitas, and scallop. The scallop was very fresh and elevated by the sauce and pancake. Carnitas was also delicious. For dessert, we had churros with ice cream. To our surprise, it also comes with hot chocolate that our server brought out and churned table side, it was a fun spectacle for us. Service was flawless.
What a beautiful restaurant, Best Mexican food in Houston, and one of the best dining experiences we’ve had.
Valet was $5.",Houston
ChIJD05oEKG_QIYRtx93E87zKCA,Paige Smith,1,"These meals deserve no stars at all. Not only was the gravy the wrong color, the food was not seasoned. Pork chops were okay. Sweet potatoes were flavorless. Cornbread was okay. The chicken gravy was, undercooked, like flour and water was mixed but not heated to the correct color / temp.",Houston
ChIJD05oEKG_QIYRtx93E87zKCA,Jennifer Brantley,3,"We came with friends after church.
There is no service. None. The best service we had was from the older gentleman busing tables. Folks behind the counter wouldn’t look at us or speak, the young lady behind the register said “what you want” when we asked for dessert and rolled her eyes the entire transaction. I mean HORRIBLE attitude for absolutely no reason, even when we tried to joke with her to make her smile - despite the service she was giving. We thrive on giving others grace, but this just made no sense. All while gospel was playing in the background.

Took the top off my dessert and let me just say - never in my life have I had peach cobbler soup, but that’s exactly what I got. Water, with sparse soggy breading and canned peaches (that’s probably why there was so much water in it). It’s nice that rice and bread are included with all meals and then you get two additional sides but the dressing was gritty and salty, black eyed peas unseasoned. Cabbage was tasty. Fish was crispy, but lacked seasoning. And we paid $70 for two people.

I hate to put down a black establishment, but the service on top of everything just made for a bad experience. Maybe only regulars get good service, which is unfortunate because we could have become exactly that.",Houston
ChIJD05oEKG_QIYRtx93E87zKCA,Lindsay Victoria,5,"Omg I'm so full that was so delicious 🤤 I ordered the smothered chicken plate which comes with 3 sides I got cabbage candied yams and Mac and cheese . The portions were very generous the only thing I regret getting what a piece of white meat as one of the 3 pieces, it was not anything compared to the dark meat which was juicy and full of flavor I also got the banana pudding but I wasn't a fan it was a little two watery for my liking but I would definitely eat here again and probably just get a different dessert there's so many to choose from so I do not feel like that was any points lost on their part. All in all I give them five stars because the food was very flavorful all the way through The portions were so big me and my son both at off a plate and we did not even finish it and on a big girl so I can eat lol but it is worth the eat and the prices is not bad at all",Houston
ChIJD05oEKG_QIYRtx93E87zKCA,Ron P. (Texas Born),5,"Houston’s This Is It soul food restaurant located in the shadows of Texas? Southern University is a staple of the community for more than 60 years. I must admit. I’ve been enjoying the delicious meals for 40 of those 60 years. What I can say is the quality of the food in terms of selection, seasoning, freshness, and portions haven’t changed that entire time. in recent years, they added a daiquiri machine and maybe a television but for the most part in their current location you can still select ox tails, turkey,l wings, fried fish, collards, mac & cheese, black eyed peas,  etc. has maintain a level of quality for a very long time. I might add that I feel people of all ethnicities and all races could come here enjoy a meal and I feel very comfortable going in and out of the restaurant and in the restaurant itself.",Houston
ChIJD05oEKG_QIYRtx93E87zKCA,Quencess,1,Only thing good there is their oxtail . Other than That their mash potato taste so fake and so does their gravy so does their yam it literally taste out of a cane smfh . Chicken is cold and tasteless . I’m not sure if it’s because I ordered it an hour before they closed or what but I didn’t enjoy the food I paid my hard earned money for .,Houston
ChIJZ4Nx6rvAQIYRAcDxd0kAv8I,Mary Morrison,5,Our department lunch was amazing.  Pleasing a diverse group of 25 people is hard but their three courses pre-fix menu worked well with vegetarian and gluten free choices.  The service was impeccable.  They have wonderful holiday decorations to add to the atmosphere.  Very very pleased.,Houston
ChIJZ4Nx6rvAQIYRAcDxd0kAv8I,David Pham,5,"Nut allergy friendly; there are dishes with nuts but the servers are very considerate.

We stopped in and sat at the bar for a quick drink and dessert. The restaurant seems very popular for brunch and dinner. Valet parking is available but we parked on the street nearby and walked a block without any issue.

The desserts here are made in-house. The chocolate truffle cake was rich and creamy, perfect after a meal. I had a mezcal based drink  that was excellent - Luis at the bar really knows his stuff.

Great date spot or a meet-up. Ask for Thomas as a server, he's great and knows his wine!",Houston
ChIJZ4Nx6rvAQIYRAcDxd0kAv8I,Anton S.,4,"Cool brunch spot. But nothing was really outstanding for us. We had cauliflower (just ok texture and flavor), chicken potato has (good) and lamb meatballs (would not recommend).
Nice patio outside area.
But I don’t like the valet service - personal preference. And then you have tip them, even though it’s “complimentary”",Houston
ChIJZ4Nx6rvAQIYRAcDxd0kAv8I,Cory Laws,4,"We were in Houston visiting family. We met a cousin for brunch. The place is cute, with a nice outdoor space, where we chose to be seated. Everything was good, and service was attentive without being intrusive.",Houston

Wow, the staff was ultimate,  the chicken sandwich was on point, my first time having an expresso martinis, and I had many this night. The ambiance. The theme was straight vinyl. As soon as I walked in, I knew I was home, A Tribe Called Quest was que'd up on the turntable. I really like this establishment, and I will be returning soon",Houston
ChIJW_JCPnTBQIYRmDWarmIfyYs,Jai Quezada,5,"I really liked this place. I was sitting outside waiting for my friend and the server immediately offered me water. The place is what I would call playful and the food was good. It was quiet as we were the first ones there but even as people came in the atmosphere was very easygoing and relaxed. Not a whole lot of parking, but there is street parking around the restaurant.",Houston
ChIJW_JCPnTBQIYRmDWarmIfyYs,Christopher Malmevik,5,"Weekend brunch is essential to life. It’s more sacred than Taco Tuesday. And it must be outdoors. I had the most wonderful experience on Sunday, by myself, while a group of young ladies were having a rambunctious birthday celebration. The atmosphere was just so relaxed in such a small space but it felt larger. My server Brenda, who by the way has “the great” added to her name on the receipt (not kidding) helped me choose between lighter and heavier fare. She had a refreshing non alcoholic suggestion, Agua Fresca that even piqued the interest of the birthday party. The food was fantastic. Chilaquiles with a side of fruit. Savory, a nice low spice of verde sauce, and a sweet end made for a great experience. Writers note: I handle the kind of spice that’ll curl your hair, so mild to me may be jet fuel for others. Highly recommended little place and I’ll be back again.",Houston
ChIJW_JCPnTBQIYRmDWarmIfyYs,c.w.,5,"this place is such a vibe — comfortable seating, good music, and friendly staff. we stayed here for a few hours, and it definitely filled up as the evening went on.

The food was delicious will definitely be back again.,Houston
ChIJJYatpkG_QIYRu3ursxZS-jc,Sarah Yip,5,I love The Fish restaurant! This is the restaurant where I learned to eat raw sushi years ago! The salmon nigiri and sashimi are really fresh and tasty. I really enjoy their volcano dish! The miso soup is overpriced but it’s good too. Excellent service and friendly employees!,Houston
ChIJJYatpkG_QIYRu3ursxZS-jc,Niiruno,1,"Do you understand the flavor of something if you taste it a lot of times, I would say that this is the worst restaurant that I have ever tried.
The food is extremely extremely bland , and the fish is one of the worst qualities that I have ever seen.
I do not expect you to understand, but when there is so many good restaurants around here in Houston, it’s very difficult to deny that this is a place only for people to look fancy, but not to eat good.
I have nothing against the service. The service was spectacular, but the food was atrocious.
This is one of the few times that I have to give a one star, but I will say, with all certainty that they deserve it.

4 stars on service because server was in training, but he was good and the manager followed up.   Great food, loved my shrimp tacos, next time I'll get the sauce on the side so I can control the heat.  That cornbread came out fresh from the oven and was delicious, definitely a grandmother's recipe.",Houston
ChIJcSuSku3AQIYRfF98hYAS130,Fawn Chambers-Knatt,4,Great Service! Drinks are awesome! Good portions are small for the price. Seafood platter was not very seasoned. Sticky pork ribs were great. Grilled chicken plate was well seasoned and great. The cornbread was the best!,Houston
ChIJcSuSku3AQIYRfF98hYAS130,Damon West,5,"I love the way the restaurant is designed; it’s a large place but the rooms feel small and intimate.
The Baked Potato Dip was a bit disappointing. It’s basically queso with bacon bits served with homemade potato chips. It was okay; I was expecting something different.
The server said the crab cake was “amazing” and he was right. It’s not a “Maryland crab cake”; it has breading and fillers but, it’s seasoned well and extremely flavorful. I wasn’t expecting a lot from the French fries but, to my surprise, they were delicious!
I’d heard good things about their Mac and cheese and that didn’t disappoint! Yum!!!
The fried chicken is well seasoned and it’s a generous portion.
The service was fantastic. They anticipated our needs, our requests were completed so fast and discretely, I didn’t even realize they brought over what we asked for lol.
Bottom line, Grace’s is good; very good.",Houston

I liked the passage door, felt like a secret dining experience but its actually the bar area. The wood trim n green paint was nice. Ole world charm. We had a jalapeño cornbread appetizer. I had a fried shrimp stuffed poblano pepper on a bed of rice and she had stuffed chicken with greens n mac.
The martinis were called side cars, n the name  was befitting..a smooth ride. Wonderful experience and our server was busy yet attentive.",Houston

The only thing I didn’t care for was the automatic gratuity added to every single item you order no matter the party size. We ordered the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, and traditional breakfast platter. The drinks were so strong that all you’d need is one. A bit pricey but worth it to me. I give it 5 stars all around.",Houston

•Took 50 minutes for our food.
•No check ups and no name from our waiter, didnt even know who our waiter was.
•The table and lights wobbled the entire time.
•Brought wrong food twice, cold as well, raw ravioli  inside terrible. Dry pork chops, crab cakes are ok NOT WORTH THE PRICE FOR ANY OF THIS

Just terrible DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!",Houston
ChIJ34hlYjC_QIYRokhNiyTitHc,Tiff Harris,1,"DONT GO THERE!!!!!!!

Staff is rude, glasses were filthy and given attitude when asked for replacement glasses, takes EXTENDED amounts of time to receive food. When food arrived it was COLD!!!!!!!!!!! In fear of something worse being done to food orders, we asked for to go boxes. The waiter says “to go already?!” I reply with “we’re late returning to work as this took a long time to even get food. He starts yelling with an attitude “well i mean we have to COOK THE CHICKEN!!!” He left came back and placed to go boxes on a neighboring chair without handing it to us. In the pictures you will see establishment is empty and this was during day time during the work week and no line of customers or anything that warranted this type of treatment from a dining establishment. The manager came and said he would comp us but didn't. We asked for the check to be split and he didn't ask who had what, since our rude server left and never came back to us. The receipts were still wrong, but were had to hurry and return to our downtown jobs. The staff hid at the back never to return, which you can see in 2 of the pictures that they’re near the back registers, including the manager that was to comp us. If you want COLD FOOD, DIRTY GLASSES, RUDE/DELAYED/IGNORED service…… then go here. Otherwise, you’d experience BETTER food and service at a Waffle House!
